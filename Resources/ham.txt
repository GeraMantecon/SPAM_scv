{'body': 'ferc gives high sign to wi pipe competition the northern illinois and southeastern wisconsin gas transportation markets , which long have been dominated by anr pipeline , moved one step closer to obtaining pipeline - on - pipeline competition yesterday when ferc awarded the proposed guardian pipeline llc a favorable preliminary determination on non - environmental issues . the decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline because not only did it shoot down most of the arguments presented by anr to thwart the project , but it found that even though the project would " adversely affect " landowner interests , guardian was making " reasonable efforts " to mitigate the impact on landowners . moreover , ferc ruled that while the $ 224 million pipeline would compete head - to - head with anr , it would not have a negative affect on the coastal pipeline and its customers . " on balance , the commission finds that the proposed guardian pipeline will provide substantial public benefits with minimal adverse impacts , " the order said [ cpo 0 - 36 ] . the commission also found that sufficient need was established for the 36 - inch , 140 - mile pipeline that would transport 750 , 000 dth / d of gas from the chicago hub to markets in northern illinois and southern wisconsin , providing customers there with an alternative to anr and access to competitive canadian gas supplies . it would terminate near ixonia , wi , where it would interconnect with wisconsin gas co . \' s distribution system . at the chicago hub , the pipeline proposes to interconnect to alliance pipeline , northern border pipeline , midwestern gas pipeline and natural gas pipeline co . of america . guardian has executed 10 - year precedent agreements with four shippers for 702 , 500 dth / d , which equals about 94 % of the project \' s design capacity . the largest shipper by far will be wisconsin gas , which has committed itself to 650 , 000 dth / d of the capacity on the proposed line . in fact , the guardian project is an outgrowth of wisconsin gas \' s request for proposals ( rfp ) process in june 1998 , which the ldc initiated in anticipation of the expiration of its firm transportation contract with anr in october 2003 . the other shippers on guardian include alliant energy ( 10 , 000 dth / d ) , wps energy services inc . ( 2 , 500 dth / d ) and an unnamed shipper ( 40 , 000 dth / d ) . the project has a targeted in - service date of nov . 1 , 2002 . in multiple protests filed at the commission , anr argued that guardian \' s application was " patently deficient " because it didn \' t include the proposed lateral that wisconsin gas plans to build to interconnect with guardian . wisconsin gas currently is seeking the approval of state regulators to build the lateral . furthermore , anr claimed wisconsin gas was using its monopoly power as a franchised ldc serving southern wisconsin to subsidize the guardian project . wisconsin gas \' s parent , wicor inc . , is one of the sponsors of guardian . the other backers are cms gas transmission and storage and viking gas transmission . but ferc rejected both arguments . " while previous attempts to inject competition into anr \' s market in this area have failed , we believe that this area is ripe for competition , and that it is only a matter of time before other pipelines submit similar proposals to the commission . we find that the proposed project will provide southeastern wisconsin with access to another source of supply , which will allow this market to enjoy the benefits of pipeline - to - pipeline competition for the first time , " the order noted .', 'subject': 'ferc gives guardian favorable preliminary determination'}

" only 12 days are allowed for intervention and comment on usually routine tariff filings , while the federal energy regulatory commission has allotted 30 days for comments on order 637 compliance filings . kmi was among the group of pipelines slated to make compliance filings june 15 . kmi said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing , but was aimed at changing its tariff to reflect " the current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices . . " it did acknowledge , " a number of the changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the commission \' s goals in order no . 637 . " indicated shippers also protested changes that would make decisions regarding negative storage imbalances and end of season inventory swaps a matter of kmi \' s discretion without any standards on how those decisions would be made . the shippers also protested changes to the default methodology for point allocations for billing purposes , and the injection of kmi discretion into the formula for accepting or rejecting predetermined allocation agreements with upstream or downstream parties . in addition curtailment provisions filed by kmi appear to be contrary to order 637 - a \' s mandate that shippers moving gas within the primary path should have primary rights . the filing also would give the pipeline the opportunity to bottle up significant quantities of coal bed methane gas in wyoming \' s powder river basin by imposing more rigorous standards on nitrogen content , according to western gas resources . a key change would impose a nitrogen gas quality specification of 3 % by volume . while kmi states the change is necessary to accommodate transfers with interconnecting pipelines , six of the seven connecting pipelines identified have no nitrogen specifications . only kmi \' s affiliate , natural gas pipeline co . of america , has similar rules , western gas said . " kmi \' s proposed nitrogen specification would enable kmi to refuse to accept coal bed methane production for transportation , thereby foreclosing the availability of one of the principal means of downstream pipeline egress out of powder river production areas , " western gas added . producers would have to shut in production while they construct costly nitrogen facilities . this could " create at least a temporary gap in the downstream movement of coal bed supplies to mid - continent and eastern markets , thus frustrating consumer access to these significant supplies .

mail category : decision brief product line : latin american energy url : summary : july 2000 marks the second anniversary of the widely publicized visit of then president - elect andres pastrana to elderly guerilla chief of the armed revolutionary forces of colombia ( farc ) , manuel marulanda . two years later , the country is no closer to peace , and resolution of the ongoing negotiations is uncertain at best . this prolongation and stagnation of the peace process has had a direct negative impact on energy sector investment in colombia . the government will likely proceed with formal negotiations , but time - - and pastrana ' s remaining term in office - - is running out . cera alert : 06 / 30 / 2000 title : argentine power markets : winter constraints push prices higher in may author : bailey e - mail category : alert product line : latin american energy url : summary : prices in the argentine power market were significantly higher in may owing to the combination of continued low hydro output , strong demand growth , and periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the buenos aires region . spot power prices ( energy component only ) averaged $ 18 . 24 per megawatt - hour ( mwh ) in may . although average power prices declined from last year , price volatility increased , with several short - duration episodes of prices over $ 60 per mwh as gas unavailability in the buenos aires region forced several midcost units offline during peak hours . in june , prices are expected to continue strengthening to the $ 24 - $ 28 per mwh range on average . beyond june , price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing hydro output , new and returning low - cost thermal capacity , and the end of gas constraints push average prices back toward $ 15 per mwh or below by august or september . cera alert : 06 / 01 / 2000 title : us gas markets reach new heights : where will it stop ? author : n . american gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas url : summary : the us gas market enters the month of june with prices at the highest level since deregulation . at the henry hub prices have surged to as high as $ 4 . 50 per mmbtu - - up from less than $ 3 . 00 per mmbtu during april . behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of supply , the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation . the gap between these two forces has been met through storage inventories , with injections so far this spring running between 1 . 5 and 2 . 0 bcf per day below last year ' s rate . the continued tension between these two forces will keep the pressure on prices this summer , and the need to inject gas into storage will price out increments of demand . cera alert : 06 / 15 / 2000 title : monthly briefing - - the pressure cooker author : n . american natural gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas url : summary : pressure remains extremely strong in the united states gas market as three factors - - the increasing power generation demand , lower storage inventories , and us wellhead supply still struggling to rebound - - call into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter . prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets , making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years . in this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer - - with pressure increasing into july as temperatures rise - - with the result that gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end - use demand . cera expects a july average price of $ 4 . 45 per mmbtu . cera decision brief : 06 / 15 / 2000 title : western canada supply growth : getting nowhere faster author : eynon , small e - mail category : decision brief product line : north american gas url : summary : as us supply declines and demand grows , current high gas prices are reinforced , but western canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering when it is needed most . both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie the disappointing production growth results . the largely weather - related transitory factors have had a near - term impact on drilling and connection activity . the underlying trends have been developing slowly over time . more shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well production rates . thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace production . with a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling , higher supply growth rates are possible , but if that does not occur , other potential supply sources may step in . significant arctic reserves in the mckenzie delta and the alaskan north slope are once again entering the spotlight . coal bed methane has become a str ! ong source of us supply . although now ignored in canada , it may become a future source of canadian gas . cera watch : 06 / 20 / 2000 title : reaching new heights author : n . american natural gas team e - mail category : watch product line : north american gas url : summary : fundamentals have taken center stage , as building demand pressure accompanies us supply declines . storage inventories have been significantly reduced , and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months . demand - driven growth continues , as completions of gas - fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10 , 000 megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand . the result is a higher - price playing field for natural gas , with the average henry hub price likely to reach $ 3 . 67 per mmbtu for 2000 - - its highest level since the development of spot markets . cera private report : 06 / 21 / 2000 title : closing the utility stock valuation gap : does strategy matter ? author : parshley e - mail category : private report product line : north american power url : summary : the stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility industry . traditionally undervalued in the market , the sector is trading at a historically wide 50 percent discount to standard and poor ' s s & p 500 . the s & p utility index over the past 18 months gained only 5 percent , with huge gains by some energy companies offset by a 15 percent drop in stock price for 29 electric utilities . yet early this year , the spu outpaced all other industry groups . how should constantly evolving utilities in this wide - open sector form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success ? the value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for 1999 - - a record $ 50 billion - - was double the 1998 value . but are these choices ahead of the curve ? and when will the market catch up ? three groups of new companies with distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape : multiservice and technology providers , superregionals , and global power and ! energy companies . three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating responses to these challenges . cera decision brief : 06 / 23 / 2000 title : the summer 2000 spot electricity markets outlook : divergent trends in price volatility author : makovich , sannicandro e - mail category : decision brief product line : north american power url : summary : while several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price spikes this summer , other markets are likely to see a reversal in price volatility as supply - demand balances improve dramatically . one way to interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations . therefore , forward prices for on - peak wholesale power reflect the common expectation that prices will spike as high as - - or even higher than - - in 1999 . a significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets . cera alert : 06 / 02 / 2000 title : atlantic basin gasoline markets soar author : meyers e - mail category : alert product line : refined products url : summary : spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season , spot gasoline - to - crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north atlantic have soared to the highest levels seen since the gulf war . in cera ' s view , this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors : very low inventories , tightening gasoline specifications , and legal uncertainty . cera alert : 06 / 13 / 2000 title : refined products line - - us markets author : refined products team e - mail category : alert product line : refined products url : summary : the us gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during may . us gulf coast unleaded gasoline surged to $ 8 . 40 per barrel measured against wti , up $ 3 . 58 per barrel over the strong april value of $ 4 . 82 . apparent demand for gasoline skyrocketed to 8 . 64 million barrels per day ( mbd ) in response to the start of the summer driving season . despite increases in the reported demand for distillate and jet / kerosene , these markets did not experience the same month - over - month strength in differentials , dropping to $ 1 . 58 and $ 2 . 58 per barrel versus wti , respectively . cera alert : 06 / 20 / 2000 title : refined products line - - european markets author : refined products team e - mail category : alert product line : refined products url : summary : as higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials to brent and thus lower refinery margins , refiners attempted to prevent this situation from worsening by reducing throughputs . however , very tight markets for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the fall in those products ' values . meanwhile , fuel oil discounts to crude oil widened in may , driving down simple / hydroskimming margins . in recent weeks , the combination of lower primary products inventories and reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to recover . this has pushed margins to above may ' s averages , although still below april ' s peaks . cera alert : 06 / 26 / 2000 title : recent actions signal progress toward mtbe elimination author : stackpole e - mail category : alert product line : refined products url : summary : the close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline ( rfg ) now faces from the media and public officials owing to midwestern market price spikes has not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl tertiary butyl ether ( mtbe ) use in the us gasoline pool . additional signposts , including heightened congressional debate over legislation eliminating mtbe use and state actions to ban mtbe , continue to emerge that point the way toward mtbe - free gasoline in the united states . cera alert : 06 / 29 / 2000 title : refined products : market update author : refined products team e - mail category : alert product line : refined products url : summary : refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences . in the atlantic basin , low gasoline inventories in both the united states and europe , which resulted from many months of opec production restraint , continue to dominate the market , and gasoline differentials above crude are at their highest level in over ten years . although signs are emerging of a possible correction in the north american market in the coming month , the 2000 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by atlantic basin refiners in many years . in contrast , asia pacific spot refining margins were weak through most of june , until the recent accident at kpc ' s mina al - ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt singapore margins . however , with ample unused refining capacity available east of suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the kpc refinery in july , cera ' s outlook is for that strength to be of short duration . cera alert : 06 / 23 / 2000 title : new peaks , new prices author : zenker , moritzburke , snyder e - mail category : alert product line : western energy url : summary : in the west , july typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and steadily rising power prices . cera expect the west to be the only region in north america with a year - over - year increase in peak electricity demand . power prices already established new record highs in june , suggesting that as demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year ' s levels . the convergence of higher gas prices , growing power demand , and reduced hydroelectric energy production compared with 1999 levels is pushing up western power prices . greater utilization of gas - fired generators within the west has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout north america . western gas prices should continue to be strong , boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across north america to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer ! power loads . cera alert : 06 / 15 / 2000 title : oil market turmoil : opec seeks a short -

driving inventories down for crude , with the side effect of lowering stocks for several products in markets such as the united states and europe . three features of the current oil market are supporting prices : * market supported * psychology enhanced * opec driven cera alert : 06 / 22 / 2000 title : opec ' s cautious new agreement author : world oil team e -

" this group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come august and september , " said nebraska coach frank solich , who has his best team since taking over for tom osborne three years ago . " we have a rich history and a team coming off a good season that is not questioning things . " we have high expectations . some of it comes from how we finished last season . a lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition . " the option and the \' huskers are inextricably bound . it is their offense , and they have been running it so long it is practically an open - book test for defensive coordinators . yet , only eight teams have passed the test over the last seven years . nebraska has won 81 games and three national titles in that span . " we try to keep up with what  , s current and we use the spring to experiment , " solich said . " but our players and coaches like to line up and beat you . our players that are here love it . it is an aggressive style of play and that  , s how they want to play it . it  , s what our players want to do on offense . " the cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged . crouch can put his name up there with the turner gill , tommie frazier and scott frost for the title of best nebraska quarterback ever , but all bets are off for this team if crouch is hurt , because the cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback . the schedule has its pitfalls too . notre dame , looking for a win that can restore luster and a reason to keep coach bob davie , gets nebraska at home on sept . 9 . a resurgent oklahoma team and top rival kansas state get nebraska at their places . kansas state won the last time the teams met in manhattan . the cornhuskers will probably play texas or oklahoma in the big 12 championship game , which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish . the cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses ralph and mike brown . but nebraska carlos polk back as the heart of the defense . polk is heralded by nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history . but come january 3 , nebraska will play florida state for the national title . and the seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack . senior writer darryl richards covers college football for foxsports . com . send your comments to darryl richards .', 'subject': 'read it and weep'}

{'body': 'ngpl recontracts with nipsco natural gas pipeline company of america ( ngpl ) continues to move through the recontracting process like a hot knife through butter . since kinder morgan took over ngpl parent kn energy last year , the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements and contract extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the midwest , including another deal announced yesterday with northern indiana public service ( nipsco ) . ngpl and nipsco signed a contract extending the terms of several firm transportation agreements totaling 295 , 100 mmbtu / d of capacity beginning dec . 1 , 2000 and dec . 1 , 2001 and continuing through nov . 30 , 2002 . they also extended the terms of two storage agreements totaling 10 . 5 bcf of capacity beginning dec . 1 , 2000 and april 1 , 2001 and continuing through march 31 , 2003 . nipsco , a nisource subsidiary , is a regulated utility that provides natural gas o nearly 700 , 000 customers and electricity to 416 , 000 customers across the northern third of indiana . " virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until the fourth quarter of this year , " said ngpl president deborah mcdonald in an interview . " basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the storage contracts are up for renewal every year . we \' ve been very successful in our efforts resigning our three major customers [ nigas , nipsco and peoples ] . " despite increasing competitive pressure from northern border and alliance pipeline , the pipeline also has had surprising luck signing agreements with marketers and power generators . " in contrast to the traditional market of long - haul transportation from the midcontinent and louisiana to chicago , we have been extending our horizons trying to find a new market in the marketers rather than the core ldcs . obviously the contract that we signed earlier this year with aquila energy for 500 , 000 mmbtu of transportation capacity has also really helped us be successful in our recontracting efforts , " mcdonald said . " we also have developed a number of new rate services for gas - fired power generators . growth in ngpl will come from natural gas - fired generation . you probably saw our press release about the ameren contracts for [ construction of 1 , 700 mw of generation along the ngpl system ] . in the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 3 , 000 mw of gas - fired generation this year and over 3 , 000 mw next year as well [ which would represent up to 900 mmcf / d in gas transportation capacity ] . " obviously another challenge is going to be [ the 1 . 325 bcf / d ] alliance pipeline coming into the market this fall . it \' s anyone \' s guess whether that will really fill up in a short period of time . i think a lot of that will be coming into chicago and moving back out on vector . but we \' re ready at hub america to kind of serve as a giant header system [ with texas eastern as an eastbound partner ] . " mcdonald was not prepared , however , to announce the results of a recent open season for about 100 mmcf / d of capacity that will be available through a new interconnection between ngpl and tetco for eastbound transportation .', 'subject': "deb mcdonald reveals a little bit of ngpl ' s strategy in interview"}

fired . these regional pressures should remain a feature of western gas markets through september . moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the henry hub . however , summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical levels . higher gas prices are likely to resurface . regional power market drivers august demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional 7 percent , or nearly 5 , 500 amw , over average june levels ( see table 1 ) . peak demand levels should exceed those in june as well , with a coincident peak over the whole western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) of 118 , 600 mw expected under normal weather conditions in 2000 , a 2 . 7 percent increase over the weather - muted 1999 peak . california alone should experience peak loads that are approximately 3 , 600 mw higher than peak levels in june . available generation capacity in the west has been at normal levels for this time of year , although coal - fired plants are responding to a record production year with repeated but short - lived outages . the steady decline in hydroelectric generation will remove 3 , 900 amw from the west resource base when compared with july levels and about 6 , 800 amw since june , although reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of hydroelectric generation during portions of june . given hydro operators ' economic interest in maximizing on - peak production at the expense of off - peak production , the loss of capacity during the on - peak period will be lower than these levels . august will be a critical month for the heavily import - dependent state of california . while the state will be drawing approximately 7 , 000 amw of imports during august to meet demands during peak periods , cera expects the level of imports to exceed 8 , 200 mw during peak demand conditions . the southwest ' s need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to export to california , and lower year - over - year hydroelectric production in the pacific northwest will limit exports from that region . pacific northwest cera expects pacific northwest demand in august to climb by nearly 1 , 300 amw when compared with june levels . the water supply for the pacific northwest has declined to 91 percent of normal levels for the lower columbia owing to warmer - than - normal weather in june . in addition , normal seasonal decline in runoff levels will drop about 6 , 000 amw from the resource base when compared with levels in june ( see table 2 ) . generation plant operators have responded to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and gas - fired generation at high levels . although less than 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired generation is currently available in the region , it has been running at high utilization rates . high energy demand in california for pacific northwest energy will keep differentials low between the regions . as in june , pacific northwest prices will respond in kind to the volatility cera expects to occur in california in august . in addition , if hot weather in the pacific northwest pressures regional energy reserves , local prices will rise to keep energy in the region , potentially causing prices in the pacific northwest to move higher than those to the south . california california is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating capacity down for maintenance . although hydroelectric output continues to decline , statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly 118 percent of normal . nevertheless , declining hydroelectric production is expected to remove about 730 amw when compared with hydroelectric production levels in june . normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about 3 , 600 amw over june levels , which were high ( see table 3 ) . california ' s peak load is expected to exceed 57 , 000 mw , compared with a peak load in june of approximately 53 , 500 mw ( 43 , 447 mw on the state ' s iso system alone , according to its own estimate ) . assuming normal plant outage rates , this demand level will necessitate the import of about 8 , 200 mw of energy to meet the statewide peak . even after curtailing the approximately 2 , 800 mw of interruptible load available for tight supply situations , the state has a precarious 6 percent capacity margin during the system peak . an extreme hot weather event could push state loads up by an additional 3 , 000 mw . outages are likely if additional imports are not available . a capacity limit of 4 , 600 mw will be in place during the summer for energy exports from the pacific northwest to northern california . the import limit from the pacific northwest to southern california will be 3 , 100 mw . rockies and southwest august demand levels in the combined rockies / southwest region will increase only slightly above levels in august 1999 , climbing approximately 275 amw , as loads in the region - unlike the rest of the below - average wscc - were near normal last august . even so , august loads will increase demand by over 1 , 250 amw when compared with levels in june of this year . as with last year and this june , supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand conditions under normal weather , although growing loads in the rockies / southwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring regions with energy during peak demand conditions . high loads driven by hot weather will keep the region ' s prices high . differentials between the region and california will be tight , but california , having tighter supply - demand balances , will need to price at a premium to attract energy . the high - capacity transmission ties between the rockies / southwest and the california market , which is about 150 percent the size of the rockies / southwest market , will ensure that prices in the rockies / southwest stay close behind california prices whenever loads are high in california . regional gas market drivers evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the west , and supply and demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures . since the northern border expansion in late 1998 , narrow north - south and east - west differentials across pricing points defined the market . this summer , the continuing supply growth in the rocky mountains has widened differentials between the rockies and the rest of the west . at topock , increasing gas demand in california and high utilization rates have resulted in high premiums . overall in north american gas markets , strong storage injection rates in recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices - from an early july henry hub price of $ 4 . 50 per mmbtu to under $ 4 . 00 per mmbtu . however , despite these high injection rates , the supply - demand balance and absolute level of storage inventories remain precarious . summer is not over and higher nationwide power loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost prices . the ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should support an average henry hub price of $ 4 . 20 per mmbtu in august . through the end of the summer , differentials in the west should hold near current levels . the pressure of growing rocky mountain supply will continue until heating loads start climbing in the fall . in california high seasonal power loads should continue through august with hot weather and continued declines in hydroelectric generation . demand strength is expected to continue . across the west , august demand for gas should climb from 9 . 8 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day in june to 10 . 4 bcf per day , buoyed by an increase in gas demand for power generation ( see table 4 ) . california high gas demand for power generation within california will continue through august . cera expects an increase from the state ' s june demand levels of 5 . 6 bcf per day to 6 . 2 bcf per day during august . the increase stems from declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads . total demand is expected to exceed last year ' s demand level by 1 . 2 bcf per day . this will increase flows on pipelines into california , reduce the state ' s storage surplus , and sustain high prices . cera expects pipeline utilization rates during august to average 95 percent ( see table 5 ) . cera expects an august topock - henry hub differential of $ 0 . 45 per mmbtu ( see table 6 ) . pacific northwest despite the extremely high prices at topock and high demand in california , until recently gas at malin priced at a slight discount to henry hub prices . after averaging $ 0 . 17 per mmbtu below the henry hub during the third quarter last year , the differential so far during the third quarter this year is $ 0 . 15 per mmbtu below the hub . this week malin is pricing at a $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu premium relative to the henry hub . the topock - malin differential has swelled to over $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu , signaling intra - california pipeline capacity constraints . two factors pressured malin differentials during the early summer . * pressure on rocky mountain and aeco differentials . prices in the two areas supplying the pacific northwest are under some pressure . increasing supplies in the rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put downward pressure on rockies prices by limiting external market access . at aeco , although export capacity out of the province is available , almost all of that excess capacity accesses eastern canada on transcanada pipeline . pipelines into the united states are running near capacity . because of transcanada ' s limited ability to discount interruptible transport , the available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled . * low early summer regional demand . gas demand in the pacific northwest is limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and very strong hydroelectric output . even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year , seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in may and june even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in california . increasing power loads are already evident . the first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the rockies and western canada begins climbing . however , gas demand for power generation in the pacific northwest has increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of july and into august as hydroelectric generation wanes . this added demand - 200 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day above june demand levels - will provide some support for malin prices and limited support for rockies and aeco prices . malin - henry hub differentials are expected to average $ 0 . 05 per mmbtu above the henry hub price during august . rocky mountains pressure on regional supplies within the rockies continues as exports out of the region reach new highs . differentials to the henry hub have widened to over $ 0 . 70 per mmbtu and although prices in the rest of the west will gain some support from high power loads , regional demand in the rockies is expected to remain near low seasonal levels through august . august demand is expected to average 1 . 2 bcf per day in the region , approximately equal to june ' s 1 . 1 bcf per day total demand . demand begins to build during september , but until the heating season begins in october , rocky mountain prices will lag well below prices in the rest of the west . cera expects a rocky mountain - henry hub differential of $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu during august . although some narrowing in rocky mountain differentials looks likely as seasonal demand increases through the fall , the rapid build in supply in the region will likely keep differentials wide during 2001 . cera expects a supply build this year of nearly 300 mmcf per day , followed by a build of over 350 mmcf per day during 2001 . currently , approximately 300 mmcf per day of excess pipeline export exists out of the region , with the largest increment on transcolorado into the san juan basin . next summer , all capacity will likely run close to full . until export pipelines expand - the first likely expansion is trailblazer - differentials will remain wide . for 2001 , cera expects an average annual differential below the henry hub of $ 0 . 65 per mmbtu . southwest differentials in the san juan and permian basins have gained considerable strength relative to henry hub prices amid the recent hot weather in texas . permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the henry hub price , and in the san juan basin prices have narrowed from an early july differential of $ 0 . 35 per mmbtu to a differential of less than $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu . cera expects demand in the southwest during august of 1 . 4 bcf per day , an increase from june ' s level of 1 . 3 bcf per day , but the larger texas market will determine the relative strength of differentials in those two basins . cera expects a san juan differential of $ 0 . 30 per mmbtu during august , with a permian basin differential of $ 0 . 06 per mmbtu . differentials between the rocky mountains and the san juan basin have widened substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the rocky mountains . flows on transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under 20 mmcf per day to over 100 mmcf per day during june . supply in the two regions is following opposite paths ; rockies supply is climbing rapidly , and san juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this year . cera expects a decline in supply of 30 mmcf per day during 2000 relative to 1999 and an additional decline of 150 mmcf per day during 2001 . because of these different outlooks , wider rockies - san juan differentials will persist . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this monthly briefing with associated tables . note : should the above url not work , please use the following : account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e -

{'body': 'attached is the latest draft of the transport option program filing . there are a couple of important changes from the last draft . one is that we \' re no longer stating that the option fee is going to be " market - based . " at ferc , the term " market - based " has connotations of having to prove to ferc that a non - cost - based rate is appropriate because we lack market power . while we probably do lack market power , the consensus of the legal / regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built - in feature of the transport rate , which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee . if this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter , let \' s discuss how it should be improved . the other significant change ( also based on my meeting with legal / regulatory ) is that i \' ve structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper , regardless of whether they currently use transport on tw , will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option . in other words , a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a maxdtq of zero . this structure has two advantages : 1 ) it \' s consistent with our option - fee - as - part - of - transport - rate theory , and 2 ) it will help support that theory in our next rate case . i \' d like to meet next week , either wednesday afternoon or thursday , to discuss the following topics : 1 ) your comments and questions on this draft , 2 ) some examples of options , to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint , 3 ) the bidding process , and how bids for options will be evaluated , and 4 ) comments received from shippers thus far . i \' ll be working on 41 tomorrow ; let \' s talk about what would be a good meeting time . i will be out mon . and tues .', 'subject': 'transport options program'}

{'body': 'new hurricane forecast out of csu renowned hurricane soothsayer dr . william gray and his team at colorado state university have scaled back their forecast for the hurricane season but still expect the season to be more active than average . seven rather than eight hurricanes are expected now and only three of them are expected to be intense rather than the four expected in the group \' s prior forecast on june 7 . in round numbers , the august forecast is for three named storms , two hurricanes , and one intense or major hurricane .

" el paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the impacted segment ; it must get approval rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a restart of the adjacent lines . but a large aggregator and a marketer agreed with the ladwp official that it should be " a quick mechanical fix " once repairs begin . the aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week . no customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting reduced volumes , an el paso spokeswoman said . northern natural gas was seeing a throughput increase of 200 - 300 mmcf / d monday while transwestern volumes were up 50 - 75 mmcf / d as a result of shippers diverting gas away from el paso \' s south mainline , an enron spokeswoman said . a producer said she diverted as much of her company \' s gas as possible from el paso to transwestern . people were reluctant to trade permian basin gas monday , especially at fixed prices , because of doubts about how much would be able to flow , several sources said . permian numbers rose a little less than 18 cents as part of the general upturn . however , it was waha prices that saw a bigger increase of nearly 30 cents as a result . " everything in el paso - permian \' s keystone pool was going back into waha , " said a marketer , putting waha in the mid $ 4 . 60 s at a premium of more than a nickel above henry hub . the southern california border , at an average of nearly $ 5 . 30 , led the rest of monday \' s market by a large margin . before trading began , enrononline was offering border swing swaps for the rest of the month at $ 5 . 85 - 95 , a marketer said . with swing swaps priced so high , it gave sellers more confidence in what prices they could command in the day market , he said . " either way , i wouldn \' t want to be short right now at the border . " there were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the el paso rupture , noted one aggregator . " but it \' s a good thing it didn \' t happen until after california had cooled off . otherwise i could easily have seen the border basis spread from san juan basin go as high as $ 2 . 50 " instead of the approximate gap of $ 1 . 70 egistered monday by daily gpi . a knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast : the structure of the crater made the rupture " look like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out . " the earth can harbor leaking gas for a while until eventually everything all goes up at once . people nearby would not have detected anything because gas is odorless in long - haul lines ; the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the local distribution stage . pipeline safety surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a leak , but this was a desert area with very little vegetation . it is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground for the approximate 500 - foot distance to the victims \' campsite and seek an ignition source there . it is a normal tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere to stay close to the ground , and that tendency would have been amplied by the chilliness of the pre - dawn desert . the source went on to say , " i think there will be lot more of this [ ruptures ] in the future with many pipes becoming at least 40 - 50 years old . " el paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early incidents , he said , because the situation applies to the other lines with old pipe . pipelines used to spend a lot more money on maintenance when regulation was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation , he said . " now they \' re more purely for - profit companies after having written off their [ depreciation ] costs many times over . " el paso blast kills 10 ; shuts down south mainline federal and company investigators monday swarmed over the scene of the devastating el paso natural gas mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak saturday , engulfing a party of weekend campers along the pecos river near carlsbad , nm , and killing 10 people . two other persons were hospitalized in critical condition . three officials from the federal office of pipeline safety ( ops ) and 11 with the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) have been at the site of the blast since late saturday , and two more ops officials were en route monday . new mexico gov . gary johnson , who flew to the area on sunday , said he wanted to know how many other potential pipeline " dangers " there are in the state . he called for a thorough investigation . about 1 bcf / d of capacity on el paso \' s southern leg initially was lost from the ruptured 30 - inch line and two looped lines nearby that were shut in after the accident . el paso was making up some of the shortfall by drawing the maximum , 200 mmcf / d from its washington ranch storage field downstream of the accident . increased use of other pipelines , allocations and cutbacks by customers , and the fact that weather had moderated in california helped ease the supply situation . nevertheless , spot prices increased by about 35 cents for points in california , while the rest of the market ( spurred by hurricane debby ) went up about 20 cents . there was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service , according to el paso spokesperson kim wallace . " we don \' t intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain that the remaining pipelines are safe , " wallace said . she did not expect them to be back in service today , and could give no time frame on when they would be returned to service . it is " much too premature at this point " to predict when the three disabled el paso westbound lines will return to service , said patricia klinger , a spokeswoman with the department of transportation \' s research and special programs administration ( rspa ) , which oversees the ops . " the one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile , and [ another line ] is badly damaged from the fire . " as for a third adjacent line , that " could potentially be re - opened , " but " we have to test the integrity of that line " and have it examined by metallurgists , she told daily gpi . " everyone will be working , of course , to try to get this [ line ] back in service . but the safe operation of the pipeline is of premiere importance . " the three lines shared the same right - of - way . " we \' re just now able to start looking at exactly what happened , and how to get that one line back in service , " klinger said . " our metallurgist is on his way right now . i know he \' s going to meet with the ntsb when they \' re examining the 50 - foot section of pipe that \' s out of the ground " as a result of the explosion . " i think the company also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line . it \' s not piggable . " the ntsb , which has set up a command center in carlsbad , nm , declined to make any preliminary speculation about the cause of the explosion . " it \' s much too early for us to even think about the cause of this accident . we \' re only dealing with the facts . . . right now , we \' re documenting the pipe itself and surveying the land . we \' re going to look at the chronology of when the [ emergency ] calls came in . . . . . document damage to vehicles , and injuries , " said ntsb spokesman keith holloway . " probably at this point we \' re looking at nine months to a year , maybe more " before the results of the investigation are publicly disclosed , holloway noted . the rupture occurred at 5 : 30 a . m . mdt in the underground line near the pecos river crossing , which is about 30 miles south of the carlsbad caverns national park in a spot popular with local campers and fishermen . the blast tore a crater in the earth about 86 feet long , 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep . according to preliminary reports , the pipeline was underground at the point of rupture , sending two sections of pipe , each about 20 - feet long , flying hundreds of feet . the gas then ignited and shot flames from the broken pipe toward sleeping campers . the ntsb estimated there was a gap of 50 to 60 feet between broken ends of the pipeline at the site . the fire burned for about 40 minutes before el paso workers manually shut off pipeline valves . ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast . the families , who were related by marriage , were camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from the ground to cross the pecos in an aerial crossing alongside a bridge . six were pronounced dead at the scene and four others died at texas hospitals saturday night . the dead included five children under the age of six , including six - month - old twins . two adults were listed in critical condition monday at a hospital in lubbock , tx . the ruptured pipeline , which el paso said was constructed in 1950 , is one of four that runs along the southern branch of el paso \' s pipeline system . there is an adjacent 30 - inch pipeline and another 26 - inch pipeline . the fourth , a 16 - inch pipeline , was abandoned and is not available for service , wallace said . el paso and federal officials are particularly interested in the integrity of the second 30 - inch pipeline that ran close to the broken line . wallace said that none of the company \' s customers had been cut off of service , but they were receiving gas as reduced levels . she also said that on aug . 2 , a " patrol " inspection , either done by air or vehicle , was conducted on the pipelines located near the pecos river by el paso officials and no problems were found . el paso conducted the last corrosion test in february and no problems were found then either . visual inspections are conducted on all of the system \' s pipelines once a month , she said , and the company follows all federal pipeline requirements for inspections . asked whether el paso planned to change its inspection system immediately , wallace said that she did not think so , but said that if the ntsb review finds something that needs to be changed , the company will do whatever needs to be done immediately . " these situations are so rare , " she said . " we don \' t feel that we need to change what we \' re doing now . but if the situation warrants , we certainly will make any changes necessary . " el paso is working with family members to take care of their immediate needs , including hotel accommodations , food , travel arrangements and medical treatment . the company also is providing additional services as needed . " this is a tragic accident and our heartfelt condolences go out to the families involved , " said el paso energy president william wise . he said the company was working with the ntsb " to investigate diligently all matters surrounding this accident and to establish its cause as quickly as possible . " the fallout of the explosion is expected to extend all across the country , as federal legislators consider more stringent pipeline rules following an explosion in bellingham , wa , that killed three in june 1999 . locally , carlsbad mayor gary perkowski said that he wanted to find out what happened and keep it from ever happening again . that reaction was echoed by the new mexico governor . " i have a lot of questions , " said johnson . " what is the reliability of these pipelines ? what went wrong ? was it preventable ? " meanwhile , rspa was sifting through its history to determine whether the el paso blast was the biggest pipeline disaster on record in terms of fatalities . timeline : 5 : 26 a . m . aug . 19 : el paso natural gas \' automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline indicates 673 . 5 pounds per square inch . around 5 : 30 a . m . : an el paso natural gas employee bow - hunting in the area sees a large fireball at the scene . 5 : 30 a . m . : el paso natural gas \' automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline drops to 377 . 19 pounds per square inch . 5 : 30 a . m . : carlsbad fire department responds to the emergency . 6 : 12 a . m . : carlsbad fire department arrives at the scene . 6 : 21 a . m . : el paso natural gas workers shut off the gas line using manual valves . between jan . 1 and june 30 of this year , there have been 40 transmission pipeline incidents , according to the ops . fourteen were caused by either external or internal corrosion ; 11 were damaged by outside forces ; three were due to construction or material defects ; and 10 were unknown . there was only one fatality until june 30 of this year on transmission pipeline incidents , which was caused by an outside force . eleven people had been injured through june . in august 1999 , ops sent a warning letter to el paso , citing it for a number of pipeline safety violations in arizona . the ops did not impose a civil fine on el paso , but it advised the pipeline that " should you not correct the circumstances leading to the violation , we will take enforcement actions when and if the continued violation comes to our attention . " - - el paso blast may cinch tough pipe safety bill the explosion on el paso natural gas \' system , which killed 10 people over the weekend , may give congress the added boost to pass a tough pipeline safety reauthorization bill when it returns from recess in september , capitol hill insiders said monday . " this just sadly proves why congress needs to act as soon as it returns [ on sept . 5 ] to pass the pipeline safety improvement act before any more innocent lives are taken , " said a spokeswoman for sen . john mccain ( r - az ) . in june , chairman mccain \' s senate commerce committee voted out the pipeline safety improvement bill that would , among other things , give states inspection and oversight authority over interstate pipelines ; require interstate pipelines to consult with states about their integrity plans ; create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety transgressors ; and offer protection to whistle - blowers who report pipeline violations . mccain proposed the agressive safety bill following the product pipeline explosion in bellingham , wa , that killed three in june 1999 . " mccain has always been determined to pass this bill this year , but this obviously sadly strengthens that resolve , " she said . he " will make a determined effort for this to happen , " but whether it \' s brought up for a vote on the senate floor will be up to senate leader trent lott ( r - ms ) , the mccain spokeswoman said . " i have no doubts " that the senate will push for pipeline safety when it returns , said terry boss , vice president of environment , safety and operations for the interstate natural gas association of america ( ingaa ) . on the house side , a companion to mccain \' s bill has been introduced , as well as a number of other pipeline safety measures , but most are at the subcommittee level . but the issue could pick up steam in the wake of the el paso blast . " we must examine why this accident occurred and ensure that it must never happen again , " said rep . joe skeen ( r - nm ) . " definitely it \' s a tragic situation , " boss said , referring to the explosion near carlsbad , nm , which reportedly left a crater about 20 feet deep , 46 feet wide and 86 feet long . five of the 10 fatalities were children , who were spending a weekend camping and fishing with their family along the pecos river . the political fallout from the disaster was being assessed in washington d . c . yesterday . " any kind of incident has political ramifications . . . . . we \' re just not sure how this is going to \' directly impact \' " pending legislation and regulations , boss noted .', 'subject': 'el paso articles today - ngi'}

flows on pgt out of alberta have averaged nearly 2 . 2 bcf per day this month . export capacity out of the region on pge gt nw is running close to capacity , and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong california demand are driving the wide malin - to - topock differentials . continuing strong demand in the south will likely keep topock prices strong , and the wide north - south differentials within the west will likely hold through september . in the pacific northwest demand is expected to climb through september to 1 . 5 bcf per day from 1 . 4 bcf per day in august . this demand level should keep malin differentials from widening from current levels . for september cera expects malin prices to average $ 0 . 10 per mmbtu below the henry hub price . southwest prices in the san juan basin this summer have been left behind by rising california demand . although the westward pull on supplies is strong , bottlenecks between california and the san juan have led to disconnects between san juan prices and topock prices . pipeline capacity utilization rates on transwestern and the northern leg of el paso reached 93 percent during july , with less than 200 mmcf per day of excess pipeline capacity . increased flows from the rockies on transcolorado and northwest are contributing to downward pressure on san juan basin supply , and in general , the san juan has followed rocky mountain prices rather than following prices at topock or the permian basin . unlike in the past two summers , the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the west coast to support san juan prices relative to permian prices . the differential between san juan and permian has averaged $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu so far this month and $ 0 . 30 per mmbtu since june . additional imports from the rockies into the san juan have increased supply by 200 mmcf per day relative to last summer , but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect . without much change in southwestern or rocky mountains local demand , the san juan should continue to price at a wide discount during september . the san juan - to - henry hub differential is expected to average $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu . as in the rockies , differentials should narrow substantially in october . rocky mountains downward pressures on rocky mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb . record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region ; generation is still largely coal - based , and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal . cera expects the heavy discount - current rocky mountain - to - henry hub differentials are around $ 0 . 90 per mmbtu - to persist through september . local area demand is not expected to change during september . substantial gain in local demand comes in october with heating loads ; october demand should average 1 . 4 bcf per day , up from august and september averages of around 1 . 2 bcf per day . although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the rockies , winter differentials are expected to stay in the $ 0 . 25 to $ 0 . 40 per mmbtu range . strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader north american markets this summer . next summer , pressures on rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer . although pipeline expansion projects have been announced - trailblazer and williams announced expansion plans this summer - the new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer . cera expects supplies within the rocky mountains to increase by 300 mmcf per day next year . western canada after widening to over us $ 1 . 50 per mmbtu , the aeco - henry differential has begun to narrow somewhat ; maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from $ 0 . 84 per mmbtu in july . with current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow , differentials are likely to persist in the mid - us $ 0 . 70 s per mmbtu for september . aeco is expected to be us $ 3 . 25 per mmbtu ( c $ 4 . 53 per gigajoule ) for september . even with the start - up of the alliance project , the contract nonrenewal on transcanada is likely to continue the two - tiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs . this will result in differentials that will range between us $ 0 . 60 and us $ 0 . 75 per mmbtu throughout the winter . supply build in western canada continues to languish behind last year ' s levels . the pace of drilling ( over 9 , 000 gas wells are expected this year ) should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into 2001 . supply is expected to be flat with 1999 on an annual basis for this year and up at least 350 mmcf per day in 2001 . sumas prices have been quite volatile , driven by both weather in the pacific northwest and maintenance on the westcoast system . for september , sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to aeco of us $ 0 . 05 per mmbtu . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this monthly briefing with associated graphic and tables . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

( fyi - epmc may re - recall this capacity , but they have elected not to ) . these additional topock supplies coming from duke and pg & e energy trading under block ii capacity may be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to pg & e at topock . this gas competes head to head with malin gas prices . for example , today ' s malin price is $ 4 . 62 while pg & e / topock price is $ 4 . 69 . today ' s cash price differential between needles and topock is $ . 60 , far larger than the previously assumed $ . 28 differential resulting from the intrastate cost required to bring topock gas to the citygate . if anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these market dynamics , let ' s discuss further at our next staff meeting . cs", 'subject': 'needles / topock price differentials'}

{'body': 'el paso south mainline shut - in extended the u . s . transportation department \' s office of pipeline safety ( ops ) has ordered all three of the pipes comprising el paso natural gas \' 1 bcf / d south mainline from texas to california to remain closed until extensive tests can be done to ensure they are safe to operate . the order came in the wake of saturday \' s explosion and fire that ripped through one of those lines , the 30 - inch pipeline 1103 , at a pecos river crossing near carlsbad , nm , killing 11 people . because of the internal corrosion discovered on the failed section of pipeline , ops is directing el paso to submit a corrective action plan for ops approval that will identify all areas on approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may be subject to internal corrosion , " said kelley s . coyner , head of the research and special programs administration ( rspa ) for the ops , in a prepared statement . the dot " is requiring that all segments of the three pipelines in the vicinity of pecos river remain closed until such time that the department has determined that the pipeline segments are safe to operate . " this is necessary to " protect the public and the environment and to prevent a similar failure on this pipeline system . " the plan will require inspection , assessment , and repair or replacement of all damaged areas . " based on the results of these and other tests , el paso must develop a plan to assess the integrity of the remainder of its 10 , 000 mile pipeline system . " the ops " corrective action order " was issued late wednesday , after el paso officials had been saying for most of the day it was only a matter of hours before at least one of the lines was back in operation . one industry source said testing could easily take three weeks to a month , even if no repairs are necessary . the ops order directs el paso to : 1 ) conduct hydrostatic pressure testing of the lines ; 2 ) perform a direct assessment of the integrity of the pipelines by both x - ray and ultrasonic examinations ; and 3 ) because internal corrosion has been detected in the failed section of the pipeline , el paso also must submit a corrective action plan to ops identifying all areas on the approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may have internal corrosion . even if el paso passes all these tests and ops allows it to return to service , each of the three lines will be subject to a 20 % pressure restriction , according to coyner . the restriction will be reviewed in 10 working days , and may be removed upon the receipt of more information about the factors that contributed to the aug . 19 explosion . ops has the authority to take other actions if warranted . the ops yesterday issued the seven - page corrective action order , which permits it to suspend or restrict the operations of a pipeline , after it determined that the el paso lines were hazardous . el paso has been notified of the order , and it has 10 days to request a hearing to be held in either houston or washington dc . if el paso fails to comply with any part of the order , it could face civil penalties of up to $ 25 , 000 a day , and the case could be referred to the u . s . attorney general for " appropriate relief " in the u . s . district court , according to stacey gerard , associate administrator for pipeline safety . preliminary investigations of ruptured line 1103 by the ops and the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) indicate that " significant internal corrosion was visible on the failed section . internal corrosion may have been a contributing factor in the line failure . the possibility of internal corrosion on other lines in the area is a safety concern . " the ops order applies to the 30 - inch line 1103 , which incurred the most damage , and the parallel 26 - inch line 1100 that " sustained an undetermined amount of damage at the pecos river crossing due to the fire . " it also covers the adjacent 30 - inch line 1110 , whose damages are still undetermined . lines 1103 and 1110 were built in 1950 , and line 1100 in 1947 . within 90 days , el paso will be required to submit to the ops southwest region director an " analysis of the continued safe operation " of the three lines " based on the testing and inspection required under this order . " in related action . rep . john dingell ( d - mi ) , who has been a sharp critic of ops for its allegedly lax handling of pipeline safety violators , is in the process of drafting a letter to the agency to determine whether its failure to take aggressive action towards pipelines may have created an atmosphere that led to the tragedy on el paso . - -', 'subject': 'el paso south mainline shut - in extended'}

{'body': 'note : this article gives some of the strategy and economics of the purchase of montana power by pan canadian . we will look at the oklahoma reserves for location and strategy with our pipe - - with the switch in ownership , they may be receptive to strategy changes . lorna pancanadian says montana power purchase \' beautiful fit \' to extend what it sees as dominance in canada \' s natural gas market and to boost its production by 10 % , pancanadian petroleum ltd . yesterday agreed to purchase montana power co . for $ 475 million . the properties will extend pancanadian \' s existing shallow gas properties in southern alberta into northern montana , adding 94 mmcf / d and 3 , 800 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids . the acquisition will give pancanadian properties in alberta , montana , colorado , oklahoma and wyoming , along with three gas pipelines linking alberta and saskatchewan to montana . " we have a focus on natural gas , " said ceo david tuer during a conference call yesterday in calgary . " this is clearly our future . it is difficult to put any negative on this ( acquisition ) and it \' s likely to stay valuable for the foreseeable future . " montana power \' s production is more than 90 % natural gas and associated liquids , and the acquisition substantially extends pancanadian \' s land and infrastructure , allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in a region that extends along the alberta - montana border . " the montana power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth natural gas , " tuer said . " the potential in these assets is significant , and over the next few years , we will add substantially to pancanadian \' s daily natural gas production . " tuer said that the acquisition extends the company \' s dominance in shallow gas , and called montana power a " beautiful fit with pancanadian \' s gas strategy , land position and technological capability . " pancanadian \' s newest acquisition adds reserves of 550 bcf and 20 mm barrels of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and one - half probable basis , said officials . production and reserves account for $ 520 million of the purchase price , while the remainder is made up of $ 135 million for the midstream and marketing assets , $ 40 million for the undeveloped land ( about 600 , 000 acres ) , and $ 7 million of working capital . tuer said the company was paying 77 cents / mcfe of proven and on - half probable reserves . the price for daily flowing production , based on a 6 : 1 ration of gas to boe is $ 4 , 450 / mcfe , or $ 26 , 710 / boe . along with the added alberta and montana properties , pancanadian also picks up some land in colorado \' s denver basin , which now produces about 31 mmcf / d . other land that is part of the sale is located in the anadarko basin of oklahoma and the green river basin of wyoming . three natural gas pipelines that cross from montana into alberta and saskatchewan also are included . the pipelines allow direct access to the u . s . markets for southern alberta and saskatchewan gas , and serve more than 1 . 2 million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands , with most of it concentrated in parcels that span the canada - montana border . midstream assets that go to pancanadian include a natural gas marketing company in butte , mt , along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation plant in colorado . the fort lupton , co plant processes more than 60 mmcf / d and 5 , 500 barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate . in all , the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly 1 . 2 million net acres , or 1 . 7 million gross acres , said pancanadian . " montana power fit us like a glove , " tuer said during the conference call . he said the acquisition will help pancanadian to remain " best of class " for what it does . " it makes our sandbox that much bigger . " the acquisition , which is expected to close around oct . 31 , will increase both pancanadian \' s net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent years , said tuer . the added gas production will immediately increase the company \' s natural gas , as a percentage of total production , to 58 % , based on a 6 : 1 ratio of gas to boe . about 25 % of the natural gas being acquired from montana power now is being sold to montana power utilities for $ 1 . 50 to $ 1 . 60 mmcf until july 2002 , and because it \' s priced below the open market officials think future earnings will be good . " as that contract expires , there \' s a lot of potential from the price in this transaction , " tuer said . and what \' s to become of montana power ? earlier this year , the 88 - year - old company , headquartered in butte , announced it would divest itself of four of its traditional energy businesses . by selling its coal production , natural gas transmission and distribution , independent power production and oil and gas exploration and production businesses , it plans to reinvest the proceeds in touch america , a fiber optics and telecommunications business , which is also a subsidiary of montana power . " the process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust , and we are delighted with the result , " said montana power ceo robert p . gannon . " we believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that cultural synergy \' s exist between the purchased companies and pan canadian .

" [ t ] here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse , collusion and affiliate self dealing of out - of - state gas suppliers and merchants , " edison told the cpuc . the company noted the cpuc already has filed a section 5 complaint with ferc regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of " certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out - of - state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially california border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity . " it notes the complaint " conservatively estimates that the anti - competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged california gas and electricity users by $ 100 million annually since the beginning of 1998 . " edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of $ 4 . 5133 / mmbtu , which was applied to sce \' s august 2000 avoided cost posting , to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the month of october and every month going forward . it estimated september bidweek border prices would average $ 7 / mmbtu . if such prices were used in edison \' s september avoided costs posting , its transition formula payments to certain independent power producers will be $ 29 million more than the month prior , the company told the cpuc . " no mechanism exists to recapture the increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in another forum that the topock border indices are unreliable at this time .

" the restoration of service couldn \' t come soon enough for el paso customers who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up el paso \' s south main leg in the wake of the blast that killed 11 people and critically injured one . california customers have been taking gas out of storage to meet their needs during the service interruption . the department of energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion and shutdown on the gas market . - -', 'subject': 'broad update on el paso system'}

" there is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse , collusion and affiliate self dealing of out - of - state gas suppliers and merchants , " edison told the cpuc . the company noted the cpuc already has filed a section 5 complaint with ferc regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of " certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out - of - state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially california border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity .

{'body': 'eia predicts supply shortfall will linger through winter the energy information administration said yesterday in its september short - term energy outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead will increase by about 87 % this winter ( october - march ) compared to last winter . residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by 27 % compared to last year . for the entire year , the average wellhead price for natural gas is projected to be $ 3 . 40 / mcf , the highest annual wellhead price on record ( in inflation - adjusted terms , it would be the highest annual average price since 1985 ) . the short - term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry \' s ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are likely to continue into the heating season , eia said . storage levels could end up being about 8 % below the five - year average of about 3 , 000 bcf by the start of winter if net injections continue at 10 % below historically average rates through the remainder of the refill season . the effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the form of significantly increased production until after the next heating season , according to the agency \' s report . " for now , we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible increases in domestic gas production for 2000 and 2001 , with assumed increases of 0 . 5 % and 1 % , respectively , for this year and next . . . , " the eia report stated . " on the other hand , the u . s . natural gas rig count on aug . 25 was at a recent high of 794 rigs . exploration and production budgets for many natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in 2000 and 2001 , spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues from producing assets . also on the positive side , data from the texas railroad commission suggest that , through may , year 2000 gas production increased , if only slightly ( 0 . 4 % ) . this signifies a turnaround ( however modest ) in a key producing region . very high gas drilling rates , including a record - setting pace in deep offshore gulf of mexico , confirm that increasingly positive results for domestic gas production are under way . " imports are projected to rise by about 12 % next year primarily because of the 1 . 35 bcf / d alliance pipeline coming on line next month . meanwhile the demand outlook remains bullish at 4 . 2 % annual growth . in 2001 , however , the forecast has been revised downward to 2 . 5 % growth because of higher than expected natural gas prices . the industrial sector is the leading sector for demand increases in 2000 at 9 . 3 % , while electric utility demand is expected to decline by 4 . 0 % primarily because of power plant sales . for the power generation sector as a whole , gas demand is expected to grow 6 . 5 % this year and 1 . 5 % in 2001 . eia said the reduced growth rate next year is largely due to the reversal in relative prices of fuel oil and natural gas , which began in august , with fuel oil gaining the price advantage as gas prices continued to rise . gas demand this winter is expected to be up by 5 . 7 % compared to last winter if weather is normal . normal weather implies a 12 % rise in heating degree - days compared with last winter .', 'subject': "eia ' s latest forecast of pricing and supply for the winter"}

{'body': 'note : alliance announced an october 30 official in - service date for tariff services ; however , they will be selling test gas in ramp up period . right now , these first deliveries are going into the anr system because it is the only interconnect that is ready . alliance delayed , but deliveries begin ramping up after months of speculation in the industry , alliance pipeline confirmed yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until oct . 30 . when construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago , oct . 2 was the target date for commercial service . however , the delay doesn \' t mean the market won \' t be getting any canadian gas out of alliance until the end of october . the pipeline opened one of its chicago delivery valves last thursday and started selling 50 - 100 mmcf / d of gas into the market . it intends to increase its sales each week eventually reaching its full 1 . 325 bcf / d load prior to switching to commercial service on oct . 30 , said spokesman jack crawford . " we got commission approval to actually sell our test gas . right now i think we are dealing with three or four different marketers . our initial deliveries right now are into the anr system . that \' s because its basically the only connection that is ready , but over the next few weeks we expect they will all be ready to go and we will test them all . " i \' d be surprised if it ends up being regular [ volume increases of 100 mmcf / d each week ] but that \' s kind of the game plan , " said crawford . " on oct . 29 it will be alliance selling [ 1 . 325 bcf / d of ] test gas , and on oct . 30 it will be shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other . the market may not see much of a difference . we obviously don \' t want to start charging our shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked out . " the pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of northeastern british columbia and northwestern alberta to the chicago area where the line interconnects with the north american pipeline grid . currently , more than 99 % of the total pipeline system has been installed , including 14 mainline compressor stations , 37 receipt points in british columbia and alberta , and 7 delivery points in illinois . commissioning activities commenced in march , including the flowing of gas into the completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe . at present , approximately 95 % of alliance has been purged of air . this includes all the mainline portion of the system ( 1 , 857 miles ) from near gordondale , alberta to the delivery section near joliet , illinois and 306 of 434 mile laterals receipt portion of the system . additionally , 25 receipt point meter stations have been commissioned . final commissioning activities are also being completed at 14 mainline compressor stations . to date , 6 bcf of gas is in the commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system , with the ultimate line pack targeted at 8 bcf . crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed start - up . " the rain in saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in july , but we managed to catch up on the construction there in august . but it then meant that some of our commissioning didn \' t get going until a little bit later . farther west in alberta and bc in fact we \' ve had a couple of rain problems . in particular , we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we haven \' t even been able to get on the right of way yet and that \' s because of rain . " up in bc we \' ve been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on one of our laterals up there , " he said . " we \' re likely to get approval to open - cut that creek , but that will take us probably the better part of a month . " on the downstream end , we had hoped to get more of our downstream connections right now . we are testing one , but some of the others aren \' t quite ready yet . we \' re ready , but they are not . then of course there is a fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the [ aux sable liquids ] plant . we haven \' t had a chance to work on that yet . so when you look at all of those things , the question was when could we establish a date when all this stuff would be done and we would be operational . we spent a fair amount of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction . we agreed we would pick one of three dates , all mondays : oct . 2 , oct . 16 or oct . 30 , and we just had to pick one that we felt confident in . " besides the timing of service , there has been another important question on the minds of many market observers . will the gas alliance ships come oct . 30 be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through transcanada . " i don \' t think it \' s going to be purely either way , " said crawford . " lots of guys are targeting for nov . 1 to bring their new gas on to start the gas year so it all depends on how much shows up . it \' s not a big secret that we \' ve had some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasn \' t gotten done . that \' s likely to have some affect on it as well . that \' s a delay though . how long are people going to pay $ 6 for gas ? boy , people are going to have a lot of money for drilling and projects .

cera alert cera alert : sent fri , september 15 , 2000 title : cera monthly briefing : supply anxiety author : n . american natural gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas , url : http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / eprofile . cfm ? u = 5526 & m = 1357 , alternative url : as the heating season approaches , a high  * but justified  * level of anxiety regarding winter supplies is driving the gas market . as things stand , the market is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter even under normal weather conditions . this prospect has placed a floor on the gas price at the price of residual fuel oil , itself priced in the mid - to upper $ 4 . 00 s range . gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market , diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply concerns again . to the upside , there is little demand response to price until industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil , as of this writing near $ 7 . 00 per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) , is breached . however , distillate markets themselves are extremely tight , and prices for that fuel would likely follow gas prices up . within this range , prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety  * the market  , s judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall , which would be characterized by extreme pricing and volatility , and a difficult process of supply allocation by price . by now , exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain . although cera expects storage injections to increase by approximately 2 . 0 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day from august to september , this increase would still leave inventories at record lows for this month and next . even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms , or if hot weather returns . for october , heating load enters the picture . with us supplies running close to year - earlier levels and imports slightly higher , demand priced out of the market will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from last year  , s low level . as a result , although prices may close the month of september in the upper $ 4 . 00 s per mmbtu , at the high end of the competitive range with resid , any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward during the remainder of september or in october . as the heating season begins , therefore , cera expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter to result in the first ever monthly average price of $ 5 . 00 at the henry hub ( see table 1 ) and the first of potentially many months at or above that price . gas storage  * new record lows cera estimates that storage inventories in the united states crossed into record low territory as of the end of august , when inventories of 2 , 233 bcf fell below the previous 1996 record low of 2 , 245 bcf ( see table 2 ) . more records will likely be broken in the coming months , and by widening margins . injections for september are expected to average 9 . 5 bcf per day , an increase of 2 . 0 bcf per day from the august level but below last year  , s pace of 10 . 3 bcf per day . cera  , s september estimate could be exceeded under mild weather conditions with no tropical activity hitting the gulf of mexico , but injections would likely fall below the 9 . 5 bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation of platforms . this rate would leave us inventories at 2 , 518 bcf at month  , s end , a record low by 87 bcf . for october , cera expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last year . injections of 5 . 5 bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by demand priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropical storm activity . october injections have varied historically from 4 . 0 bcf per day ( 1989 ) to 8 . 5 bcf per day ( 1998 ) . even if injections reached toward the upper end of this range , the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the winter . at the expected injection rate , us inventories of 2 , 689 bcf at the end of october would result in an end of march 2001 inventory level of 669 bcf under normal winter weather , 89 bcf below the previous record low of 758 bcf . regional markets  * waiting for winter the pipeline explosion on el paso during late august intensified the subregional pressures already at play in western gas markets . cuts in pipeline flows limited access into california on the only pipeline route into the state with any excess capacity . the lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and forced strong storage withdrawals in the california market . although summer power loads in california will ease and much of the el paso capacity has been restored , the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter heating load will keep intense pressure on topock prices . differentials in the rest of the west will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply to ease pipeline bottlenecks ( see table 3 ) . differentials in the east , which have traded in a narrow range this summer , will likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in october . however , exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this year . cera  , s outlook by region follows : * rockies . pipeline bottlenecks out of the rocky mountains this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb during october . cera expects that as local demand limits pressure on pipeline capacity , differentials will narrow . october differentials should average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * san juan . the resumption of flows on el paso  , s southern system , combined with production outages , has relieved some of the access constraints on san juan supply . seasonal declines in rockies to southwest flows and the beginning of the heating season should narrow october differentials to $ 0 . 35 per mmbtu . * permian and mid - continent . the continuing pull on supplies from the west will support permian prices , and the midwestern pull on supplies will support mid - continent prices . cera expects a differential to the henry hub of $ 0 . 06 per mmbtu for mid - continent supplies and $ 0 . 11 per mmbtu for permian supplies . * chicago . the delay in the in - service date for alliance from october 2 to october 30 will take some gas out of the chicago market next month . this delay , combined with the need to build midwest storage inventories , should sustain the recent increase in differentials from the $ 0 . 05  ) $ 0 . 08 range to above $ 0 . 10 per mmbtu . cera expects october differentials at the chicago citygate to average $ 0 . 11 . * northeast markets . gas prices near $ 5 . 00 have increased the fuel cost of delivery from the gulf coast into the northeast , raising the floor level for differentials to near $ 0 . 30 per mmbtu . the beginning of the heating season and the lack of new capacity into the new york citygate should support differentials above the floor during october , at near $ 0 . 40 per mmbtu . canadian markets  * outages affect supply outages have affected supply thus far in september . both british columbia and alberta have been affected , resulting in a further year - over - year decline in western canadian supply . the various problems appear to be rectified , but the average supply for the month is likely to be down 100 to 150 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day from september 1999 . drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet weather , but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels . more than 8 , 400 gas wells are expected for this year . slight drop in export demand eastern canadian demand is still down approximately 200 mmcf per day , with cooler - than - normal weather reducing the need for air conditioning . in the west however , cooler - than - normal weather has accounted for an increase in demand for heating requirements of about 200 mmcf per day . exports are down slightly in september compared with september 1999 , with pg & e gt - nw off 110 mmcf per day . northern border is running even with september 1999 . storage picture brighter in canada storage injections in eastern canada have picked up , with inventories now expected to reach the five - year average of 210 bcf . in the west , inventories at the end of the injection season will not only be above the five - year level but should be even with those of 1999 , at 250 bcf . wider differentials holding after widening substantially in august to us $ 1 . 17 , the aeco - to - henry differential has closed back to a more typical level of $ 0 . 60 in september . september  , s aeco price should average us $ 4 . 15 per mmbtu ( c $ 5 . 79 per gigajoule [ gj ] ) , increasing in october to us $ 4 . 35 per mmbtu ( c $ 6 . 07 per gj ) . * * end * * cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e -

{'body': '* utilicorp wants to spin off aquila kansas city business journal  ) 09 / 29 / 2000 by brian cookson utilicorp united inc . wants to parlay the rapid growth of its aquila energy subsidiary into a piece of a new , larger aquila . the kansas city - based utility has plans to spin off aquila , possibly retaining ownership of a third of it , selling another third to a partner and offering the remainder in the stock market . the move could allow aquila , now engaged primarily in trading power and natural gas , to gain more hard assets of its own and seek higher valuation from investors .  & we really think the value of our company is much higher than the market currently values it because it values it as a utility ,  8 aquila spokesman al butkus said . aquila , which moved its headquarters to kansas city last year , has been the engine behind earnings growth for utilicorp . for the second quarter of this year , aquila reported earnings before interest and taxes ( ebit ) of $ 49 . 5 million , up 113 percent from the previous year . utilicorp as a whole had ebit of $ 103 . 9 million for the second quarter of 2000 . aquila may be able to attract more interest because it wouldn  , t carry the image of a traditional utility , butkus said . richard stuebi , president of next wave energy , agreed . the head of the denver - based electricity consulting firm said wall street historically has undervalued conglomerates such as utilicorp .  & in general , the stock market prefers companies that are clean or pure plays ,  8 stuebi said . aquila  , s strategy comes as little surprise to stuebi . as much success as the company has had , he said he thought aquila would need to get bigger to compete .  & in most aspects of the energy business , the race for scale is on ,  8 he said . aquila also could increase its value to shareholders by looking for hard assets to match its marketing prowess . aquila ceo keith stamm said the company could address this need by building , such as the new electric generation plant it is building in pleasant hill . it also could buy generation capacity or take on a partner with electric generation capacity . stamm said the company is looking for such a partner but is keeping the other two options open . finding a partner with power plants could become easier as energy deregulation causes many utilities to look at separating generating operations from power sales and distribution . stamm said that aquila has talked to several companies and that an announcement could come by the end of the year . the timing of any initial public stock offering would be dependent on the results of the search for a partner . butkus said utilicorp isn  , t sacrificing its hold on aquila . instead , executives are hoping to own part of an infinitely more valuable company . aquila already is moving to enter a new market  ) trading bandwidth , or capacity on communications networks . stamm said the bandwidth market is potentially several times larger than the energy market because communications networks can be linked by satellite to anywhere in the world . gas pipelines require a physical connection . traders in the bandwidth market could include telecom companies or internet providers that either have network capacity to sell or that need to boost their capacity .  & we like to see volatility , and we  , re seeing it ,  8 stamm said . aquila is adding a crew of 35 to 40 people to begin trading bandwidth by the end of the year . it won  , t be alone , however , as companies such as houston  , s enron corp . also are getting into bandwidth trading . * * * * * * * *', 'subject': 'news : utilicorp plans to spin off aquila energy'}

{'body': 'note : the market reaction is interesting . one can surmise that quite a bit of the gas that was contracted for on vector is firm utility gas . the run up in chicago may be temporary until alternate arrangements are completed . vector delay confirms market \' s suspicions future shippers on the new chicago - to - dawn vector pipeline had their fears confirmed tuesday when pipeline officials announced that the start - up date for the project , which was scheduled for nov . 1 to coincide with the start - up of the long - awaited alliance pipeline , would be delayed until dec . 1 . vector officials blamed the delay on the excessive rainfall that has hampered construction of the pipeline , which - - - when completed - - - would provide initial takeaway for about 700 mmcf / d of the 1 . 3 bcf / d of western canadian gas that will be shipped to the chicago market by alliance . alliance is due to begin operations on oct . 31 . the announcement yesterday left many in the market asking the million - dollar question : " where will that [ alliance ] gas go ? " in the meantime . alliance officials noted the line has connections with existing pipelines and ldcs serving the chicago hub that could pick up the slack between oct . 31 and dec . 1 . alliance \' s jack crawford downplayed the impact of the vector start - up delay on alliance . " we don \' t think [ there will be ] much effect at all . we have been working closely with vector . our connection with them , if it \' s not ready , is very close . we also have five other connections with other [ existing ] pipelines and ldcs " in chicago . many shippers " understand [ that with ] a startup the magnitude of ours [ alliance ] and vector \' s , there are likely to be some bumps at beginning . " immediate market reaction to the news was somewhat unexpected . the chicago basis for november widened from a plus 9 . 5 - 10 to plus 11 - 12 tuesday following vector \' s announcement . that is contradictory to what you would think would occur , said a chicago trader for a large marketing company . " i was offering index - plus gas today betting on the chance that will come off by the time bidweek rolls around , " he said . the effect on the market wasn \' t as profound as some would have thought , agreed another trader . " in fact , chicago prices actually strengthened on the news . you would think that with the excess gas on the market starting nov 1 , the basis would have come off . the only thing i can think is that people are betting on cold weather showing up in the chicago market on nov . 1 as well . " meanwhile dawn prices , which one would have expected to strengthen following the news , did so , as november basis widened from low 30 s to plus 36 yesterday following the announcement , a michigan trader said . the vector pipeline would transport much of the alliance gas from the market hub in chicago to the hub at dawn , on , as well as provide access to markets and storage in the upper midwest . the line eventually will carry 1 bcf / d , but its initial start - up delivery capacity will be 700 mmcf / d . the pipeline is slated to serve key markets in ontario , quebec , and the u . s . midwest and northeast . ~ vector shippers were notified of the delay along with the rest of the market tuesday , although many already had suspected the pipeline wouldn \' t be able to adhere to its scheduled start - up date . at an ldc forum in chicago a few weeks ago , a spokesman for vector insisted the pipeline was on schedule , but then sources said he showed pictures of parts of the pipeline underwater . " folks who were there knew what that meant . " presently , more than 90 % of the vector line has been installed and progress on the springville compressor station is on schedule , according to the company . the dec . 1 start - up date includes adequate time for any further weather impacts and for the extensive commissioning and testing programs necessary , it said , adding vector is scheduled to begin filling the system in late october to complete the commissioning of facilities . sponsors of vector include calgary - based enbridge inc . with a 45 % interest ; westcoast energy inc . of vancouver , bc , with a 30 % interest ; and detroit - based mcn energy group inc . with a 25 % interest .', 'subject': 'vector announces a one - month delay until december 1'}

( e . g . a 20 m / d package might involve a day bidding process , a 100 m / d block may involve a week posting ) . demonstrate that puts / calls don \' t undercut the release market . explain that release is used for day to day decisions , while we believe options will serve to help shippers with longer term strategic decision . be specific about any waivers of the part 284 regulations . work on the definition of the 4 options types . they stumbled over some of the wording , like the use of phrase " recall " in the transporter call . detailed notes we had a surprisingly positive reception from rates west . this could be due in part to mike coleman \' s reputed continued interest on the electric side and his self - proclaimed corporate bent . he did say that he understands the underlying business drivers for this program and suggested that a flushed out narrative with the filing to explain these would help our efforts . he said that the timing on this type of offering is good now , as the chairman is pressuring staff to improve the marketplace ( the california situation again ) . both groups suggested that we needed to lay out as much detail as possible in the filing , including examples of each type of options . as mike delineated and we expected , the major issues that may cause discomfort are affiliate abuse and capacity hoarding ( cornering the market under a long - term option ) or speculative capacity holding . to defend the service , we should lay out the impacts and explain why this offers an improvement over our present situation ( discounted firm ) . some specific questions from the rates group included : how does this impact capacity release how does tw protect against hoarding why aren \' t all options considered negotiated rates . are options tradable alone ( without capacity ) would the availability of options change the volume of capacity held by ena how are rofrs affected some specific questions from the policy group included : what are discriminating parameters / business decisions in allocating capacity how are competing offers allocated when in excess of available capacity how are options posted , bid on ? what are parameters of the options , specify range is it in the contract is this a physical or financial product does this verge into negotiated t & c territory ? is this like koch \' s option proposal ?

{'body': 'alliance deliveries delayed until nov . 13 in a move that is likely to send ripples through the market , particularly around chicago , the 1 . 325 bcf / d alliance pipeline extended its commercial in - service delay last week to nov . 13 from oct . 30 . pipeline officials said moisture and debris in the line caused the delay . " as we have increased the flow of test gas volumes during our system commissioning , we have encountered moisture and debris from construction , " said ceo norm gish . " specifically , most of the debris is in the form of small pieces of foam from the [ smart ] pigs that were used to remove the hydrostatic testing water from the line . the problem forced us to shut down the system for short periods of time to clean out accumulated debris . " we have since designed and installed additional in - line screens at our compressor stations . the situation is improving and we are removing ever - decreasing amounts of debris with increased flows of test gas . however , this situation has not permitted us to run our system with the significant volumes necessary to adequately test the reliability of our compressors . " it is the second time alliance has had to delay its in - service date . in early september , alliance officials said rain in saskatchewan this summer , directional drilling problems at a creek in british columbia , complex connection problems with the aux sable liquids plant in illinois and connection delays with several u . s . pipelines and ldcs was to blame for a one - month delay to oct . 30 ( see daily gpi , sept . 11 ) . the pipeline will continue increasing test volumes until it begins commercial service , said gish . there currently is about 500 mmcf / d of test gas in the line . he expects firm delivery capacity to reach the full 1 . 325 bcf / d prior to nov . 13 . alliance officials also noted that this is the first time a pipeline the size of alliance has been brought on stream at one time . regardless of the challenge , however , market participants were expecting the system to be delivering gas starting at the beginning of the month of november and this delay is likely to have a significant impact on november bidweek trading . one chicago trader said he had a strong suspicion something was fishy when his index offers were lifted friday afternoon by a marketing company , which he knows to own capacity on the pipe . " everyone was a buyer of index gas today for november , especially those now short for the first 13 days . i sold mine at ngi plus 1 . 5 , but had i known that alliance was delayed i would have held out for something a little better .

{'body': 'i consulted with kevin before i took the oars in trying to answer your question , as well as the questions raised in drew \' s e - mail . here \' s what we found out . . . steve \' s question : what economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new mexico ( maybe 3 , 000 mw ) and build a line to the grid in california versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in california ? what you \' re really asking here is " what are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline ? " in this analysis , there are a few considerations - - ( 1 ) original capital cost to construct facilities , ( 2 ) the operating cost of the facilities , including energy loss , and ( 3 ) environmental and other permitting considerations . engineers tell us that , as a rule of thumb , high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately $ 800 , 000 to $ 1 mm / mile to construct turnkey . this figure is comparable to the $ 1 mm / mile " rule of thumb " we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameter ( 30 - 36 " ) high - pressure steel pipeline . in terms of operating costs , for anything over 100 miles in length , there are three ( 3 ) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission : ( 1 ) transformation loss , ( 2 ) radiation loss ( efm ) and ( 3 ) heat loss across the conductors . a rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3 % . this number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on transwestern \' s pipeline . the most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission lines is in the area of permitting . there just aren \' t many new transmission lines being approved . it was suggested by more than one source that an electric transmission project on the order posited in your example , could take anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization . the issues of electromagnetic field ( emf ) radiation around high voltage power lines , along with other wildlife endangerment concerns , are significant obstacles in securing permits for right - of - way . in short , the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines , the protracted permitting process for electric transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure . drew \' s questions : 1 . what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant ? for purposes of this exercise , i \' m assuming we \' re talking gas - fired generation . developers generally describe four considerations in deciding where to site a new electric power plant : 1 . market area demand ( distributive ) and / or transmission access to market 2 . water rights for turbine cooling 3 . ease of permitting ( environmental , encroachment , fed / state / local regulations , affected agencies / jurisdiction ) 4 . proximity to natural gas pipeline / supply infrastructure 2 . do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilities / power pools vary all that much or are order 888 tariffs pretty much the same all over ? ferc order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and between other utilities and / or power pools in the various operating regions . ferc ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate their transmission / reliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions . the rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under ferc order 436 / 500 / 636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines . it \' s pretty obvious from the california example this past summer , that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states , particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of independent system operators ( iso \' s ) , there is substantial room for improvement ( and possible further ferc involvement ) . " in the open access final rule ( order no . 888 ) , the commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service . all public utilities that own , control , or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff . they must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases . order no . 888 also provides for the full recovery of stranded costs - - that is , costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplier . " 3 . how do ipp \' s decide what fuel supply strategy works best ( i . e . , buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs . buy gas , storage , transport , etc . separately ) ? in my experience , there is no " one size fits all " formula or strategy . for example , in the past we \' ve seen calpine take a very hands - on approach to supplying its ipp projects . in the mid to late \' 80 \' s , during the build out of several qf \' s ( cogens ) , calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project . in today \' s market , calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from statoil and set - up a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western u . s . power projects . in other projects , developer / owners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply / transportation to the project . in short , projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply / transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or rfp \' s for gas supply / transportation , or whether to take a more hands - on approach ala calpine . 4 . what is the rto rule and why should we care ? last december , the ferc issued order no . 2000 , a final rule on regional transmission organizations ( rto \' s ) . order 2000 builds on the foundation of orders 888 and 889 ( issued in 1996 ) . according to ferc chairman jim hoecker , order 2000 makes " a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants . " therefore , order 2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in orders 888 and 889 , continuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate , not state or regional boundaries , as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privately - owned transmission companies . ferc prescribes a voluntary approach to rto participation . the order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster rto formation . the order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned " public utilities " that are subject to ferc jurisdiction , and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning state / municipal , cooperative and federally owned systems . ferc believes that , regardless of format , rto \' s will offer the following benefits : ( 1 ) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industry , ( 2 ) improve efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion management , ( 3 ) improve grid reliability , ( 4 ) remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practices , ( 5 ) improve market performance , ( 6 ) increase coordination among state regulatory agencies , ( 7 ) cut transaction costs , ( 8 ) facilitate the success of state retail access programs , and ( 9 ) facilitate lighter - handed regulation . critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility , voluntary rto formation and transmission rate reforms ( i . e . , incentives ) , order 2000 defers for case - specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational rto . moreover , order 2000 does not compel any transmission owner to join an rto , but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants , as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the hold - outs . as to the final part of the question ( " why should we care ? " ) , presumably , the development of a fully - functioning rto network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original ferc orders . as ferc reads it , the future of gas - fired generation for both merchant and utility systems , depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system . therefore , the promise of the rto is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure . unfortunately , sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the rto program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals . 5 . has $ 5 / mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market ? natural gas prices of $ 5 / mmbtu can only " kill " gas - fired power plants in those instances where ( 1 ) there are more economical alternatives to natural gas fuel , ( 2 ) demand for electric power is offset through demand side management or ( 3 ) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel . in the western u . s . marketplace , particularly in california , i see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation . renewable resources currently meet less than 5 % of the total electric resource requirements . $ 32 / barrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas ( even at a $ 5 / mmbtu price ) . moreover , california environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible . while demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs , historically , they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power . as to the final point , i \' m unable to comment on the risk of future legal / regulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel . steven harris 10 / 26 / 2000 10 : 05 am to : kevin hyatt / et & s / enron @ enron cc : jeffery fawcett / et & s / enron @ enron subject : re : electric developments since you are the " expert " in this area , i need to know what economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new mexico ( maybe 3 , 000 mw ) and build a line to the grid in california versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in california . if you could let me know by next friday i would appreciate it . kevin hyatt 10 / 25 / 2000 04 : 32 pm to : sharrisl @ enron . com cc : subject : electric developments steve , see below . drew asked me to help him out with his meeting . kh - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by kevin hyatt / et & s / enron on 10 / 25 / 2000 04 : 34 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - enron energy services from : drew fossum 10 / 25 / 2000 01 : 49 pm to : dari dornan / et & s / enron @ enron , lee huber / et & s / enron @ enron , tony pryor / et & s / enron @ enron , maria pavlou / et & s / enron @ enron , susan scott / et & s / enron @ enron , jim talcott / et & s / enron @ enron , kathy ringblom / et & s / enron @ enron cc : michael moran / et & s / enron @ enron , kim wilkie / et & s / enron @ enron , kevin hyatt / et & s / enron @ enron , john dushinske / et & s / enron @ enron , shelley corman / et & s / enron @ enron subject : electric developments when we originally decided to use my staff meetings for " graduate education " one of the hot topics was the electric industry . we all had a first lesson on this topic in shelley \' s electricity seminar last summer . now , john and kevin have graciously agreed to join us tuesday at 1 : 30 to discuss recent developments in electric markets and nn \' s and tw \' s efforts to attract power generation load to the system . specific topics i hope to cover include the following : 1 . what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant ? 2 . do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilities / power pools vary all that much or are order 888 tariffs pretty much the same all over ? 3 . how do ipps decide what fuel supply strategy works best ( i . e . , buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs . buy gas , storage , transport , etc . separately ) ? 4 . what is the rto rule and why should we care ? 5 . has $ 5 / mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market ? depending on how deeply we get into these topics , we may need to schedule a follow - up session at a later date . i look forward to seeing you on tuesday . df', 'subject': 'electric developments'}

{'body': 'note : the ferc meeting is today . see the link below that can be checked for updates . enron \' s lay urges bold solutions to power market woes as the federal energy regulatory commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal government \' s answer to california \' s be - deviled power market , free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the cal - iso . ferc \' s meeting is scheduled to start at 9 am est . ( check http : / / intelligencepress . com this morning for updates ) in a letter fired off to ferc chairman james j . hoecker yesterday , enron ceo kenneth lay urged the commission to find a fix for the underlying structural problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers who have placed " price cap \' band aids \' over hemorrhaging wounds . " lay told hoecker the power market is " halfway across a busy street in its transition from monopoly to competition . it can \' t stand where it is . " he said ferc has to make a choice between falling into the " same trap of political expediency as california \' s iso , leaving the nation \' s electric system in the lurch from one crisis to the next , [ o ] r it can take a big step toward fundamental structural reform . " at the same time the electric power supply association ( epsa ) called on ferc to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the cal - iso from " unilaterally implementing " any changes to its current $ 250 / mwh price cap for wholesale electricity purchases . in a motion filed monday , the marketer group specifically asked the commission to bar the cal - iso board of directors from putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex load - differentiated price cap of $ 100 or less during the off - peak season effective nov . 3 . the plan was designed by the state \' s main utility consumer group ( see daily gpi , oct . 30 ) . in addition , the epsa urged ferc to " state explicitly " that the cal - iso does not have the authority to impose or extend price or bid caps , unless expressly authorized to do so by the commission . the cal - iso \' s current authority to set price caps expires on nov . 15 . lay said the cal - iso \' s complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of gas - fired generation , " making obvious errors such as failing to take into account gas transportation costs between the henry hub and power plants in california ; in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to sell their gas supply , rather than use it to make electricity in california . " the new formula also forces the iso into the market to buy power on an ad hoc basis " to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract sufficient supplies ( which it inevitably will do ) , " lay said . in addition , the capped formula " invites generators to shut in production , export power out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries . " he noted that the iso \' s chairman voted against the measure while all of the state \' s utilities voted for it " presumably knowing full well that it simply will not work . " california is " just the latest failure of partial or compromised open access , " said lay . " it \' s time for the commission to reject this approach . " the power industry - - - the nation \' s most essential industry - - - is mired in the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice . every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one vested interest or another . as a result , utilities are free to slow the interconnection of new generation , withhold equal access to the transmission system , favor their own sales over those of competitors , miscalculated available transmission capacity , and exercise control over supposedly \' independent \' system operators and reliability organizations . lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would " plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods . . . " ferc has to complete the work that it started , said lay . it has to ensure that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by " ending the special priority for utility uses of the system . second , ferc must require transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets from their other businesses . third , ferc must take politics out of transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure independence . finally , ferc must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies . " epsa said the cal - iso board " acted in obvious disregard for the commission \' s orderly processes .

{'body': 'note : raymond james and associates is predicting gas prices to average $ 4 . 50 in 2001 . consensus first call estimates are now averaging $ 3 . 85 for 2001 . read on to hear what the brokerage houses are predicting . lorna raymond james sends chills up gas buyers \' spines raymond james and associates gave gas buyers a halloween shriek yesterday that could be producing chills all the way through next april , perhaps even all of next year . the firm released a chilly forecast of double digit gas prices this winter and said it expects prices to average $ 4 . 50 / mmbtu in 2001 . " regardless of a potentially warm winter , it is highly likely that the united states will experience regional shortfalls in gas supply , " raymond james said in its latest energy report . " in other words , gas storage should test all - time low levels this winter regardless of weather . " the situation should get worse , not better , next year . if we end the winter at all - time low storage levels and we cannot inject more gas next summer than we did this summer , then we should enter next winter with dangerously low levels of natural gas , " raymond james added . " we believe that the united states will see gas demand increase by about 9 bcf / d ( or 15 % ) by the end of 2002 as new gas fired electric generation plants come on line . unfortunately , even if every drilling rig is working , u . s . gas supply is likely to increase by less than 4 bcf / d by the end of 2002 . this means that gas prices must rise sufficiently to crimp over 5 bcf / d of demand out of the gas supply / demand equation by 2002 . at $ 5 / mcf , only about 1 . 5 bcf / d of demand has been reduced so far . that means that gas prices must go higher over the next several years . " however , raymond james \' bullish predictions are a far cry above the crowd on wall street . plenty of other analysts have upped their forecasts recently to hair - raising levels . the first call consensus for 2001 now is up to $ 3 . 85 / mmbtu . but that \' s still 65 cents less than the raymond james \' s prediction . not everyone wants to scare the daylights out of buyers , however . deutsche bank believes analysts and the futures market participants at nymex " are getting bold and in our view maybe too bold . " " with the natural gas rig count approaching 850 , it is hard to believe that there will not be a fairly substantial supply response in 2001 , " deutsche bank said in its energy wire on friday . " analysts at the u . s . energy information administration are expecting dry gas production to rise to 18 . 94 tcf ( 51 . 9 bcf / d ) in 2001 , after being stuck at near 18 . 7 tcf ( 51 . 2 bcf / d ) for several years . our own estimate for 2001 looks for 19 . 1 tcf ( 52 . 3 bcf / d ) and we have seen credible forecasts reaching as high as 19 . 7 tcf ( 54 bcf / d ) . in general we think the eia is way too conservative and that our own number is more likely to be adjusted higher rather than lower . a gain in domestic production of 2 bcf / d to 53 . 2 bcf / d could be doable . imports appear likely to be up 0 . 5 bcf / d . if demand rises by 2 . 5 % , that would account for about a 1 . 5 bcf / d gain . all other things equal , this implies that storage can refill and suggests that prices are going to come under some downward pressure .

" we \' re just keeping our legal options open , " said a san francsco - based utility spokesperson , noting that the utility also is attempting to protect its financial status , which was challenged tuesday when fitch placed it and another california utility on a " rating negative watch . " state and federal officials all acknowledge as part of a series of ongoing investigations that california \' s current wholesale electricity market is broken and noncompetitive in its current state , said roger peters , senior vice president and general counsel for pacific gas and electric . " however , there has not yet been any concrete action by regulators to provide for recovery of the costs we have incurred to purchase the power our customers must have , either through refunds from power sellers who charged unfair prices , or through retail rates . these costs are continuing to grow .

" normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has been removed from the line , " says alliance ceo norm gish . " however , periodic reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the aux sable liquid products processing facility near chicago . " a spokesman said the debris included " bits of foam " that came off equipment used to extract moisture following hydrostatic testing . the complexity of the alliance pipeline operations also has led some observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service . the pipeline has an immensely complicated system patented by alliance engineers that is designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1 . 325 bcf / d of natural gas from british columbia and northern alberta through 1 , 900 miles of pipe to the aux sable liquids extraction plant near chicago . the pipeline also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown calgary control room . alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines : a physical pipe , a paper pipe and an e - pipe , which brings all aspects of the operation together around the clock 365 days a year . " it \' s a tremendously complicated system and all the parts are interdependent , for it to work , they all have to work together . " regardless of the delay , however , alliance already is flowing a large amount of gas into the chicago market . " at this point in our commissioning activities , the system is flowing at approximately 40 to 50 % of capacity . we expect to continue increasing the volume of test gas and approaching our firm delivery capacity of 37 . 5 million cubic meters ( 1 . 325 bcf ) per day prior to the end of november .

these fields could add over 0 . 5 bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater gulf of mexico , with 0 . 5 bcf per day in 2000 and 2001 , and onshore , led by the bossier sand play in freestone county , texas , the barnett shale play in wise county , texas , and the powder river basin coal seam play . * further increases in drilling are likely to slow . new deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs . producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews . regional markets - wild winter in the west extremely cold weather in the west has brought rockies prices close to parity with henry hub prices and triggered early season spikes at sumas in the north and topock in the south . pipeline maintenance on el paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to topock differentials of over $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu . tight pricing relationships to the henry hub in the san juan and rocky mountains should hold through february , with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline . winter has arrived in earnest across north america , but the start - up of firm transportation service on alliance is delayed once again , this time until december 1 . nonetheless , flows on the pipeline are under way ; cera estimates that flows during october averaged 450 mmcf per day . during november that total should climb to 750 mmcf per day , despite the later published start date . with or without alliance flows , a weather - driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to november and december last year should keep prices in chicago at a significant premium to henry hub prices . in the northeast , differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter , despite greater flows into the region from atlantic canada this year ( see table 3 ) . cera \' s outlook by region follows : * rockies . very cold weather within the region has brought rocky mountain prices near parity with henry hub prices . a break in the cold or a cold snap in the east will likely widen the differentials , but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu below the henry hub price . cera expects a december average differential of $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu ; however , this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather . a warm week in the rockies could still push differentials toward $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * san juan . san juan prices will continue to hold close to rockies prices through the winter , with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions . heating loads in the rockies will determine the san juan to henry hub differential , with extended cold weather in the rockies pulling both prices close to the henry hub price . cera expects the december differential in the san juan basin to average $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu . * permian and mid - continent . unlike prices within the rest of the west , differentials between the henry hub and the mid - continent and permian basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter , as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west , depending on regional weather . cera expects a permian to henry hub differential of $ 0 . 11 per mmbtu and a mid - continent differential of $ 0 . 08 per mmbtu for december . * chicago . alliance flows into the chicago market are now running close to 750 mmcf per day . however , the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed chicago differentials up to near $ 0 . 15 per mmbtu relative to the henry hub , despite delays in the completion of the vector pipeline . cera expects the strong pricing at chicago to continue , and december differentials should average $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu . * northeast markets . assuming normal weather , we expect to see december basis for new york relative to henry hub at $ 1 . 03 per mmbtu . new england will likely see prices $ 0 . 05 - $ 0 . 15 higher , depending on the pipeline . much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs . for example , with a 9 percent retention rate from the gulf coast into new england , last december would have seen retention costs of approximately $ 0 . 22 ; at $ 5 . 70 , that same retention equates to $ 0 . 50 . despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the northeast from the atlantic canadian fields , there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets , and an additional 166 , 000 mmbtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity . because of this tightness , should this month \' s weather be colder than normal , we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in january 2000 . these spikes could even exceed the highs seen in january , depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized . canadian markets - winter begins the colder - than - normal weather has increased demand in western canada but is only now being felt in the east . storage peaked in the west in early october at approximately 225 bcf below last year \' s level and 6 bcf below the five - year average . even with modest withdrawals since that time , storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs . easter canadian storage has continued to grow , pushing levels to over 245 bcf , 11 bcf above last year and well above the five - year average . with the eastward movement of the colder weather , withdrawals are likely to begin . this higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on transcanada . the good news resulting from the cold is a more normal " freeze - up , " which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season . gas well completions are expected to reach 8 , 500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year . further delays for alliance ? the " commercial " in - service date for alliance has been delayed until december 1 , the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line , delays in the completion of the aux sable liquids extraction plant , the delay of vector , and a lack of supply . the pipeline has been flowing gas , however , with volumes building up since september . it is estimated that flows for november will average 750 mmcf per day . transcanada has taken the full brunt of the alliance flows so far , with northern border and pgt remaining strong . december should see alliance flows build to between 900 and 1 , 000 mmcf per day , with modest reductions in flows on northern border and pgt . storage withdrawals will likely keep transcanada reductions close to 350 mmcf per day , year - over - year , until vector begins service to eastern canada . high prices : strong pull west the high demand in the pacific northwest has also provided strength for aeco . the aeco - henry differential has dropped to the high $ 0 . 30 s and low $ 0 . 40 s as a result of this increased pull . for december , the differential is expected to average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu , for a resulting aeco average of c $ 6 . 97 per gigajoule ( us $ 5 . 10 per mmbtu ) . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this message with associated tables . cera \' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

{'body': 'western undeterred by grueling regulatory process expressing frustration but continuing its resolve , texas - based western hub properties is ironing out some " technical issues " of financing with california regulators and now expects to start construction in february on its delayed lodi gas storage field in northern california . the merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year , said western hub \' s california - based manager , jim fossum , who added that with faster approvals , the project could have been in service during this summer \' s electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages . despite the regulatory struggle , he said the company still plans to go through with its other california storage project near bakersfield and the natural gas hub called wheeler ridge . western has acquired leases on the property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed site over the first three to six months of next year . the company intends to make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001 . in both the approved lodi project ( see daily gpi , may 19 ) and the proposed wheeler ridge storage field , western is not concerned about lining up customers , said fossum . the projects are not contingent on contracts , he said . " now that we are a bona fide ( certified plant ) utility under the california public utilities commission , we are getting some technical things worked out with the commission staff and nailing down the last small pieces of property , fossum said . " everything is basically ready to go at lodi " " we have to file with them documents that verify certain aspects of the project \' s financing . we can \' t move ahead with the financing until the cpuc approves it . " if we had not encountered all of the roadblocks that we have had , we could have helped with the problems this last summer , and we could be helping with problems right now . " he added that the project would not be operational in time to have any impact on the upcoming summer electricity demand and corresponding heavy natural gas demand to fuel power plants . lodi and the wheeler ridge storage project are being designed as high - deliverability storage facilities . lodi will have about 9 bcf of working capacity , building to 12 bcf . initially , fossum said , lodi should have about 400 mmcf / d injection capability and 500 mmcf / d withdrawal . in the southern half of the state , western for some time has been doing reservoir studies near wheeler ridge and now has a " couple of reservoirs that we think might work , " fossum said . " we \' re in the preliminary planning phase .

{'body': 'attached below is the cpuc \' s proposed decision in the gas industry restructuring proceeding . essentially , it adopts the interim proposal with a few modifications . the cpuc states that they are taking a " cautious " approach to deregulation in light of recent market events in both electricity and gas , and therefore , rejected the more robust reforms outlined in the comprehensive settlement . the cs was offered by socal gas and supported by many of the settlement parties , including enron and transwestern . the good news is that , with respect to hector road , the maximum volume at hector is limited to 50 mmcf / d , similar to the proposal made by the comprehensive settlement . i \' ve included the section from the pd that deals with this issue for your convenience . the full document is also attached . excerpt at at page 50 regarding hector road : ( 1 ) receipt points / intrastate transmission as we have already discussed above , we now judge that intrastate transmission unbundling is not wise at this time for the socalgas system . however , socalgas  , intrastate transmission system can still be made more accessible and understandable to its users . in r . 98 - 01 - 011 , the record reflects dissatisfaction among customers and shippers with the lack of clarity on how socalgas schedules gas shipments through its windowing system , and socalgas  , sole use of the hector road interconnection as a receipt point . ( exh . 8 in r . 98 - 01 - 011 , pp . 29 - 31 ( southern california edison company market conditions report ) , ( panel hearing testimony of mr . paul carpenter , southern california edison , tr . pp . 931 - 932 , jan 25 , 1999 ) . ) our decision in d . 99 - 07 - 015 directed investigation into using the hector road interconnection , even on an interim basis , and the publication of socalgas  , windowing criteria in tariffs . socalgas filed advice letter 2837 , which detailed its process of basing a maximum amount of gas scheduled for shipment through a receipt point on the prior day  , s nominations , except at the first of the month . early in the instant proceeding , the alj held in abeyance active consideration of the windowing procedure tariff socalgas filed , pending the resolution we reach today . ( prehearing conference of september 1 , 1999 , p . 34 . ) we are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowing process with a system under which socalgas will establish receipt point capacities , subject to daily revision , on the basis of the physical maximums for each receipt point under the operating conditions expected for that day . customers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will be posted on socalgas  , gasselect system daily prior to the nomination deadlines . if , in the aggregate , customers nominate more than the physical capacity at any receipt point , gas will be scheduled based on the upstream pipeline  , s capacity rights system . for wheeler ridge , at which more than one upstream pipeline delivers gas , the maximum daily physical capacity would be allocated between upstream sources pro rata on the basis of the prior day  , s scheduled deliveries from each source . this system eliminates the mystery in how pro - rations are made , provides continuity in capacity rights between the interstate and intrastate systems and provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the most cost - effective receipt point on any given day . we recognize that it does not provide for long - term planning , but the alternative under the cs of paid - for firm receipt point rights for the term of the settlement has the disadvantage of locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the term . in this period of gas price volatility , we believe that the more flexible plan is the right one . thus , we direct socalgas to withdraw advice letter 2837 and file a new advice letter within 10 business days implementing the proposed receipt point physical capacity system . this may be the same as the exemplary tariff filed with the is or updated as necessary pursuant to subsequent proceedings . this tariff revision will be effective within 30 days after the filing unless rejected by the energy division . in r . 98 - 01 - 011 , pg & e and edison particularly complained about the restrictions at wheeler ridge . ( exh . 15 in r . 98 - 01 - 11 , pp . 7 - 9 ( pg & e rebuttal to market conditions report ) , and exh . 8 in r . 98 - 01 - 011 , pp . 29 - 31 , ( southern california edison , market conditions report ) . ) one response in the is to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point at hector road for all customers , subject to wheeler ridge access fees and surcharges . its capacity will be 50 mmcfd or greater as long as there are nominations of that volume and mojave pipeline company delivers that much in response to those nominations . this provision should allow greater flexibility for shippers and customers as well as leveling the playing field between socalgas and others at this interconnection . we will support socalgas  , application to the federal energy regulatory commission for approval of hector road as a formal delivery point by mojave . el paso natural gas company objected strongly to the provision in the is for automatically expanding of wheeler ridge capacity while this was not an option specifically mentioned in d . 99 - 07 - 015 , we do not choose to stand on that technicality to exclude it from consideration here . once a proceeding is open to settlement , the dynamics of settlement talks may bring in matters outside the delineated scope , as they have done here with regard to wheeler ridge expansion and , for instance , pooling . both proposals respond to concerns raised in r . 98 - 01 - 011 , ( see citations in text above as well as panel hearing testimony of mr . benjamin c . campbell , pg & e , tr . pp . 267 - 268 , jan 19 , 1999 ) ) and neither was specifically excluded from further consideration in d . 99 - 07 - 015 . we therefore view them as within the scope of this proceeding . to the extent that other receipt points are also viewed as constrained , we welcome evidence to that effect in a future proceeding , as well as proposals for criteria to determine when expansion should be applied for . by 100 mmcfd if a certain number of curtailments occurred , and for automatically allowing the expenses of that expansion to be rolled into rates . we do not wish to approve automatic rate increases for all ratepayers for a facility for which only some may have use , but we believe that developing criteria for expansion of receipt points is useful . hector road may not entirely alleviate the problem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south . therefore , we approve that portion of section iii of the is that sets forth criteria for expansion , but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria , socalgas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt point capacity . that application shall be processed in the regular way , with the issues of need in the context of the entire system and foreseeable market conditions considered . moreover , rolled - in or incremental rates , allocation of cost among classes and consequent rate design will remain open for decision in that proceeding . thus , the modification to the is that we make is in the first sentence of the first full paragraph on page 8 . the words  & apply to  8 should be inserted after  & socalgas will  8 . we specifically disapprove the is language in the middle on page 8 beginning with the words  & this settlement  8 through the end of the paragraph , and the concomitant language in appendix a setting the cost at $ 12 million in 1999 dollars . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by jeffery fawcett / et & s / enron on 11 / 27 / 2000 08 : 45 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : jeff dasovich on 11 / 22 / 2000 06 : 28 pm sent by : jeff dasovich to : jeffery fawcett / et & s / enron @ enron , susan scott / et & s / enron @ enron cc : subject : bad proposed decision well , this shows the direction in which the " new " commission is heading . the very good news , though , is that tw \' s proposal was included in both settlements ( now that \' s hedging !

" the california independent system operator ( iso ) , a non - profit public benefit corporation responsible for maintaining transmission reliability and ensuring adequate electricity supplies , hailed la paloma as a welcome addition . " as north america  , s only regional transmission operator relying on competitive market forces to maintain the critical balance between electricity supply and demand for california  , s 27 million electric customers , the california iso is very pleased that pg & e  , s national energy group has stepped forward with the la paloma facility to fill an essential consumer need , " said cal iso president & ceo terry winter . " this investment shows that the market is responding to the growing demand for electricity . " " as a highly efficient plant from both an energy and environmental standpoint , california consumers will benefit , " added pg & e corp . \' s boren . " the la paloma generating plant provides highly competitive costs with a minimum of energy consumption and environmental impacts . " the la paloma plant site is approximately 40 miles west of bakersfield , calif . in western kern county on an industrial site previously used for oil production . when completed , it will be the state  , s largest facility designed from the ground up exclusively as a merchant power plant . a merchant plant sells its electrical output to wholesale customers in a regional competitive bulk power market . those wholesale customers , which include traditional utilities , municipal utility districts , retail energy services companies , wholesale power marketers , and electric cooperatives , in turn arrange to have the electricity delivered to retail consumers . the la paloma development team has selected abb alstom power inc . as the turnkey contractor for the project . abb alstom power is responsible for the design and engineering work , the procurement of equipment and management of sub - contractors , and the actual construction of the facility . the la paloma generating project received its california energy commission approval in october 1999 , and the financing package for the project is being completed now . " the rigorous permitting process really laid the ground for an outstanding construction program , " said roger garratt , project development manager for pg & e corporation  , s generating unit .

{'body': "the gd article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good readers digest version of the order . susan and i spoke with jeff dasovich and mark baldwin yesterday , and the consensus of those conversations was that transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of implementation / documentation . jeff offered that he might send a letter to governor gray ' s office expressing both dismay and indignation that the cpuc didn ' t complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to california ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved . he may ask the other comprehensive settlement parties to join in signing the letter . susan , mark and i spoke about this idea later , and we ' ve got some reservations about tw ' s role in admonishing the cpuc . we should probably wait to see this letter first before committing to anything . bilas draft cautious toward socal competition mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state , california public utilities commissioner richard bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more moderate approach to promoting competition on southern california gas  , ( socal ) system . in his draft decision , bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundling of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case , the less far - reaching interim settlement ( is ) , submitted in december 1999 . socal , san diego gas and electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the is , reaching a comprehensive agreement in april this year . but since then , gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state , prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name . the draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements . recent events  & lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation , the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm , tradable intrastate transmission rights , should be delayed ,  8 according to the draft order .  & this unbundling is the basis of the [ comprehensive settlement ] and we cannot approve it . we do not , however , wish to commit to paralysis until 2006 , as the [ post - interim settlement ] would have us do . accordingly , we believe californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption , with modifications , of the is .  8 the biggest change to the is in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by socal at wheeler ridge , calif . , with rolled - in rates if certain criteria are met . el paso energy had objected to the provision in the is that would have allowed socal to automatically expand capacity at wheeler ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of curtailments oc - curred . el paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at wheeler when only certain customers would benefit . the draft says socal can file a separate application for the wheeler ridge expansion , but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing process . the draft decision would also :   end socal  , s current    establish hector road as a formal receipt point for nominations ;   institute an operational flow order ( ofo ) procedure . provides a forum for more changes in ofo procedures if excessive ofos are made ;   set up    make changes to balancing rules , while retaining the current 10 % monthly imbalance tolerance ;   make socal  , s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balancing rules and penalties as all other shippers ;   allow some limited imbalances trading , as well as the right to assign and reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market , with a socal electronic bulletin board set up for it ;   unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost exceeding that required for core minimum reliability ; and   provide for rate recovery of up to $ 3 . 5 million in implementation costs . in addition , the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from rates , eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges , eliminate the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs . the threshold for participating in core aggregation is reduced , and billing options are offered to core aggregators . bilas  , draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to open another investigation into gas competition , taking into account any changes in market conditions . bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft .  we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by marketers if more competition is allowed ,  8 bilas wrote in the draft decision .  & with half the state already committed to a restructured competitive natural gas industry , it suddenly seems as if the benefits of such re - structuring to enhance competition are speculative , particularly at this time . with one leg in the water , the current has switched direction and it will be difficult , if not foolhardy , to reach our goals by forging ahead .  & we choose to take a cautious approach again ,  8 the draft continues .  & rather than proceeding to unbundle transmission in southern california now , we approve , with modifications , the settle - ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market . additionally , we unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the legislature to pass consumer protection legisla - tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core aggregation programs .  8 the cpuc would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and other restruc - turing in the future  & but believe that at this point in time the certain benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers .  8 all drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be discussed . the draft decision is currently on the agenda for the cpuc  , s dec . 21 meeting .", 'subject': 'proposed decision'}

{'body': 'drive to succeed : enron prefers toyota to gm to prosper in the new energy economy , enron coo jeffrey k . skilling says oil and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead reshape themselves to resemble toyota when it captured the imagination and pocketbook of u . s . consumers 30 years ago . in a somewhat back - to - the - future treatise on how enron expects to continue its monumental success , skilling told arthur andersen energy conference attendees to define themselves not by their industry , but rather by their skills base . toyota changed the u . s . auto industry by outsourcing its production , offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster . the energy industry has to do the same thing into the future , he told the houston audience . " in 1982 , the energy industry was a very rigid industry , " he said , pointing to a similar business model that had been used by general motors and ford motor co . those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process , keeping all of its pieces within the corporate structure . then toyota turned things upside down . when a customer wanted a different radio , toyota relied on outside producers . it didn \' t stop the production line to please the customer . and it was able to do it faster . enron has used the same model to shape its achievements , packaging components for customers to save time and money . other energy companies are now adopting that method . in many ways , skilling said enron views itself as the toyota of the energy industry . " we don \' t feel we have to provide all components , but package them the way the customer wants them . this is a pervasive trend we are seeing all over the industry . " enron , which has had a shareholder return of 1 , 333 % in 10 years ( january 1990 to november 2000 ) , saw the changes required by new technology and deregulation and redefined its core competencies , which grew from its pipeline business . skilling said to remain successful , the houston - based corporation plans to continue to morph . " it all hinges on one good idea enron had in the 1980 s , that vertically integrated structures had dominated our industry and the structures were starting to break up . in the energy industry , the reason was deregulation . fundamentally , this is a better business structure for two reasons : you can be supplied with cheaper cost components and it allows you to change much more quickly . " instead of bigger energy companies , skilling said he expects to see many smaller companies , " maybe thousands tied together electronically and vertically . " the transformation and interaction costs are " collapsing across the economy . " as an example of interaction costs , skilling used bank tellers . in 1985 , it cost a bank $ 1 . 50 a transaction . to bank on the internet today , it costs a bank less than a penny . this drop in interaction costs is a major reason enron finds the bandwidth market so attractive . in 1995 , the length of time to provision bandwidth was six to eight months . today , it \' s two to three months . and next year , skilling predicts it will take one second . " we will have bandwidth on demand by next year , " he said , and added that enron plans to be the leader in the field . similarly , long - term gas contracts in 1982 took two to three years to execute . in 1989 , they took nine months . three years ago , they took two weeks to execute . today , using enrononline and other similar internet trading systems , it takes less than one second . " all of the sudden the world has changed . we have the same manufacture cost , but interactive costs collapse . i think that because of this , we \' ll see the collapse and demise of integrated energy companies around the world , " skilling said . to survive , skilling advised companies to " virtually reintegrate " what they need . " if you have an old vertically integrated mind set , it \' s tough . give it up . i know there are still power producers who are buying gas reserves . i don \' t get it . it makes no sense whatsoever . you can get it online at the lowest cost . if your business strategy is dependent on this , it will be a very hard row to hoe . " each stage of production will become increasingly competitive in the next 10 years , predicted the enron president . " you \' re not just competing against three people in west texas , but thousands around the world . " opportunities exist , he said , for those companies that " go with the flow and find ways to compete . create low cost , dependable market interfaces . . . provide packaged turnkey solutions for customers through complex structures , differentiation and customization . " the only threat is from the old way of doing business , he said . " but there is tremendous opportunity to do things for customer you \' ve never been able to do . " he suggested a " new " energy model based on brainpower , networking , offering real options to customers , moving quickly and being entrepreneurial . " at enron , this has been the whole premise : to be able to change by responding and reacting to the environment . by getting components together and packaging them for the customer .

{'body': 'update from cera on pricing and rest of the season . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by lorna brennan / et withdrawal rates decline with inventory as field pressure is reduced . * pressure in the market will be reinforced and extended through 2001 and probably into 2002 . during the past two summers , high prices have been required to discourage demand and allow overall us storage injections to reach barely 1 . 6 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) . if normal weather holds for the remainder of this winter , 2 . 2 tcf of injections - which would be nearly impossible to achieve - would be required during 2001 if inventories are to recover to 2 . 7 tcf at peak . if weather this winter is merely normal from mid - december through march , going into winter next year the united states will have considerably less gas in storage . reaching even the 2 , 362 bcf level , according to cera estimates ( see table 1 ) , would require an additional 275 bcf of injections next year , and that alone would prove challenging . price - the cold weather path the weakness of storage inventories and the demand pressure in both core and power generation markets created by the cold weather have caused prices to move onto and even above cera \' s cold weather path for this winter ( see table 2 ) . storage inventories would become perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather through mid - december proves accurate , and the injections required next summer would keep pressure in the market intense . for these reasons cera \' s outlook for prices for january and throughout 2001 now reflects the cold weather path . prices could take an even higher path , particularly if colder - than - normal weather endures beyond mid - december or returns on a sustained basis in january or february . several forces that could weaken prices during 2001 will begin to enter the market during the winter , but these are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the winter is over . such factors include a building us supply capability , growing imports , softening oil prices ( allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter ends ) , and potentially weakening economic growth . although the influence of these factors will increase , it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement that appears more and more certain next summer . demand - the difficult next round of switching with gas prices hitting new record highs , cera expects some additional demand to be priced out of the market . because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most weeks since may , however , the easiest fuel switching in the power generation and industrial sectors has already occurred . even though gas prices are currently above the level of distillate ( approximately $ 7 . 23 per mmbtu in new york ) , switching from gas to distillate requires changes in long - standing consumer habit , will occur only over time , and is likely limited in volume . significant switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of distillate itself . there are four major sources of additional demand response in industrial markets : * additional switching to resid in industrial boilers . the next increment of demand to come out of the market is likely to be in the industrial sector , through additional fuel switching to resid ( and to some extent to distillate ) . these markets will continue to show some flexibility but will not represent a large volume . cera estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably already begun to lose small amounts ( less than 0 . 5 bcf per day ) in switching to resid , given the consistency of gas price premiums greater than $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * investment in restoring switching capability . as premiums move far beyond this level , industrial end users can be expected to take a closer look at reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their initial short - term levels . however , such a change would require investment by industrial end users and the availability of resid in oil markets . cera estimates that with focused investment over the course of a number of months to perhaps a year , switching to resid could eventually reach as high as 1 . 3 bcf per day . there is already some movement here ; given the impact of high gas prices on earnings , energy prices have already begun to receive management attention . * switching to distillate . us department of energy data suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical capability of switching nearly 1 . 3 bcf per day to distillate in the short term . this switch would represent additional distillate demand of over 200 , 000 barrels per day ( bd ) in a us market of 3 . 8 million barrels . this marginal demand would move the distillate price in tandem with gas price , and any additional switching among power generators to distillate would reinforce this price correlation . in addition , the availability of distillate inventories on site should restrict the quick switching to short periods of time and will not offer a long - term solution to tight markets . * shutting down industrial plants . also offering some flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that use gas as a feedstock . the major feedstock consumers are the ammonia and methanol industries , and , not surprisingly given the tight margins available , manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to show suppressed gas demand . however , in the short term only a portion of ammonia production is at risk . whereas the production needs of merchant facilities along the gulf coast is relatively readily replaced by imports , substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast ( because of transportation logistics ) and for facilities whose production is linked to value - added fertilizer products . hence , cera still estimates that even with nonexistent margins , substantial ammonia production would continue , with additional losses of perhaps 200 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of potential demand in addition to the facilities that have already closed . extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the shuttering of north american methanol capacity , putting at risk another 100 to 200 mmcf per day of gas demand for that sector . switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated in the chemicals , paper , and refining sectors in the south and the food products sector in the midwest . continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the south central region . for process users , even extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have little impact on the use of gas in the short term . energy costs are not the dominant component of production costs for these users , and a physical changeover would be time - intensive and elemental in its impact on end - use product quality . the northeast - cold weather operations begin all of the northeast pipelines have issued notices to customers that they either have imposed , or are highly likely to need to impose , transportation restrictions of various types . the most common restriction is to nonprimary firm services ( secondary and interruptible type services ) , which will be scheduled for the next several days on many pipelines . other pipelines have issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and deliveries must match . even hourly flow orders have also been implemented . these actions are normal for winter operations when a cold period is expected . whereas the firm market for natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions , the spot market becomes much more volatile as interruptible supplies dry up . the spot market , primarily made up of nonfirm customers , has had a dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of delivered spot gas into the market area , as has been reflected by the volatility of the cash market this week . the result of these restrictions of nonprimary firm services has been an expansion of basis to henry hub . at one point , gas for next - day delivery to new york traded near $ 24 . 00 per mmbtu delivered , although the average price was closer to $ 14 . 20 . these high spikes are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas . although these restrictions will likely ease as temperatures return closer to normal , cera now expects basis into the new york citygate to average $ 1 . 31 per mmbtu for december and $ 1 . 36 per mmbtu for january . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated tables . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit http : / / www . cera . com / ceraweek / this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

{'body': '- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by lorna brennan / et the accident further limited pipeline capacity into california for a two - week period . during that time , the market drew heavily on storage inventories and further weakened storage positions . as hydroelectric generation declined through the summer , the price strength extended into northern california . malin , which had been pricing near parity with the henry hub in the summer , began trading at a $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu premium to the henry hub in september . the summer and early fall market set the stage for continued and more intense spikes this winter . the following factors are now driving this market : * continuing surges in gas demand . gas demand levels have remained high since early summer , driven by higher overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric output . demand levels for the third quarter in the us west averaged 10 . 7 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day , up from 8 . 7 bcf per day during the third quarter 1999 . persistently strong gas - fired generation production through the fall months diverted gas to power production , frustrating efforts to fill storage . this pressure will continue . the year - over - year demand increases from the power sector will be compounded , as evidenced in november , by swings upward in residential and commercial heating demand of 800 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day . overall , cera expects nearly 1 . 6 bcf per day of increased demand in the west this winter , with the critical california and pacific northwest regions showing 1 . 2 bcf per day of increased demand . key power sector drivers , including the strong economy , colder weather , and lower hydroelectric generation , will continue to push gas - fired generation . * pipeline utilization nears capacity . strong western demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western pipes to high levels . flows from british columbia into the northwest pipeline have remained at high levels since summer , while flows from the rockies on northwest have remained at pipeline capacity . flows on pgt into kingsgate have remained at or near capacity , although approximately 300 mmcf per day of excess capacity exists on pgt into california at malin . likewise , flows out of the rockies on kern river pipeline have consistently remained at capacity . the only slack pipeline capacity remaining for west coast gas markets has been on southwest pipes . during the past few months , these pipelines have operated at their highest utilization rates since the addition of capacity from canada early last decade . the high utilization of western pipeline capacity - reminiscent of power plant capacity constraints that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the west this summer - leaves very little slack capacity to provide a relief valve for demand spikes . and that is exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks ( see figure 1 ) . given the level of storage inventories and expected gas demand , flows on the el paso and transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher flow levels from december through march than they have averaged through november . * deteriorating storage position . at the start of november california storage inventories held at 154 bcf , a full 32 bcf below the five - year average inventory level . the strong in - state withdrawals during november weakened that position to 128 bcf ; the deficit swelled to 62 bcf . inventories in california have never fallen below 60 bcf , so deliverability through the end of winter is likely less than 700 mmcf per day . storage inventories in california are so low that utilities \' ability to balance withdrawals from storage with purchases from demand - sensitive price points is severely limited . if the cold weather blast anticipated for mid - december materializes , this effort at balance will be even further compromised for the remainder of winter ( see figure 2 ) . * short - term contracting . a significant amount of western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market . a shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline capacity to spot transactions - in many cases in response to gas and power industry deregulation - has left the west much more exposed to spot market volatility . in other areas of the country , utilities have significant firm pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the citygate and / or have forward purchased gas ( at previous and lower prices ) for at least some portion of their winter supplies . as a result , unlike in eastern markets , a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of california utilities will be exposed to the current price spikes . * no alternatives . a lack of fuel - switching capability prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas prices . power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices . not surprisingly , gas prices pushed the cost of gas - fired generation beyond the federal energy regulatory commission \' s ( ferc \' s ) proposed price cap of $ 150 per megawatt - hour , setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit . a small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable . significantly , air emissions restrictions - already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this year - will make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial california market highly unlikely this winter . a recent meeting of the south coast air quality management district , which has jurisdiction over the los angeles area , concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits . market forces unite for price spikes during november the first cold weather - related demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets . a cold weather system in mid - november brought temperatures averaging 47 percent colder than normal - the temperatures actually averaged 14 percent colder than a normal january week - and provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the west coast . capacity constraints on moving gas into california that appeared during the summer extended north into the pacific northwest as heating loads climbed . this core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation . the high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages . gas demand in the us west during the last two weeks of november was boosted to approximately 15 . 5 bcf per day , driven by heating demand increases of 2 . 8 bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage - related demand increases of 1 . 0 bcf per day . these demand spikes caused buyers - already dependent on the spot market - to bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of november and into december . since demand outstripped supply , prices rose dramatically at all western price points , and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels . citygate prices surged beyond $ 40 . 00 per mmbtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly $ 15 . 00 per mmbtu for december bidweek at topock . daily spot gas prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many western market regions . west coast to remain disconnected through the winter although the week of november 13 could prove to be the peak demand week in the west this winter , cera does not expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the west coast any time soon . storage inventories are so low that the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities . generators , which already rely heavily on the spot market for supplies , are faced with a bidding war for scarce supplies . colder - than - normal weather would likely keep west coast prices in the $ 20 . 00 - $ 40 . 00 per mmbtu range . more normal weather would allow a slow decline from current levels of over $ 20 . 00 per mmbtu down into the $ 15 . 00 - $ 20 . 00 per mmbtu range . however , the storage situation and underlying demand strength mean that any return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early january . this winter will prove a critical test for western gas markets , and the end of the heating season will likely provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in the west coast market . as heating loads diminish significantly in march and storage deliverability is no longer a critical issue , premiums should retreat back into the $ 1 . 00 - $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu range . as hydroelectric generation begins to increase , the pressure could subside even further , but storage injections during the spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines even during the spring . the unique vulnerability of the pacific northwest the west coast price pressure is not limited to california . high demand in the pacific northwest ( and more indirectly in california ) will keep upward pressure on prices from sumas to stanfield . northwest pipeline capacity from the rockies was already fully utilized at the onset of the cold weather and even so can only provide gas so far into the pacific northwest . the combined california and pacific northwest demand pushed stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are bidirectional there . the only supply source for the load centers in southern british columbia and even more so in northern pacific northwest ( such as seattle ) are from westcoast at sumas . the westcoast mainline from the producing fields in northeast british columbia has also been operating at capacity . the same bidding forces felt in california have been evident at these western canadian price points , pushing sumas prices into the $ 20 s per mmbtu . these forces will persist , keeping sumas at a premium to aeco over the winter - and in much closer relationship to california prices . customer response : another log on the backlash bonfire with power plants and gas utilities paying the current high spot prices , consumers \' bills from vancouver to san diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity prices . the gas industry has been preparing for rate shock this winter , warning regulators and customers alike . however , the price spikes in the west and the sustained premiums in western markets move beyond alarming . capacity holders are reaping significant rewards for their investments in capacity positions , resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from consumers to capacity holders . market power and market gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will find easy application in their gas market counterpart ( no matter what their merits ) . some level of investigation into the natural gas markets during or following this challenging winter should be expected . as has occurred in the power markets , this will now turn attention to gas purchasing practices , particularly in california . the likely outcome of this process will be a shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases toward a more flexible portfolio approach . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated graphics . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 -

{'body': 'high prices force chemicals to sell gas , futures chemical companies , forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas prices , are nevertheless making money - - - by selling gas futures contracts . terra industries and mississippi chemical corp . became the latest companies to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs . iowa - based terra industries said it had sold off a portion of its december natural gas purchases , and shutdown 50 % of its verdigis , ok , ammonia facility . the company had previously reported that it would not operate its bytheville , ar , and beaumont , tx , facilities during the month of december as well . in a similar maneuver , mississippi chemical corp . , a producer of nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium - based products in mississippi , louisiana and new mexico , reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from january forward , in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered by soaring natural gas prices . mississippi chemical said it expects to realize a pre - tax gain of $ 16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending dec . 31 from the recently sold contracts . the problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being mimicked by chemical prices . an overabundance on the market has kept chemical prices relatively low , while gas prices , a feedstock for some chemicals , continue to climb . the difference in the latest shutdowns is that the companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products , said ron phillips of the fertilizer institute . duke energy \' s ken nyiri , divisional director of strategic planning and research , commented on mississippi chemical \' s transactions , " i guess they probably made about a $ 4 / mmbtu margin on the gas , which is significantly more than they could make on the ammonia ; in fact , they would have lost $ 30 / unit . their ammonia was probably costing them about $ 205 / ton to make ( with gas bought at $ 5 / mmbtu in november ) and the market today is at $ 205 so basically they would break even on their ammonia production costs . by selling the gas at around $ 9 / mmbtu they made $ 4 / mmbtu . it was just a question of do they convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it , or do they sell the gas and make $ 16 million . " michael l . bennett , executive vice president of terra , said , " the natural gas price increase since our december requirements were purchased for verdigris permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with the natural gas . we will evaluate the economics of bringing verdigris back to full production near the end of december when january \' s natural gas purchase commitments must be made . " terra estimates the idled facilities represent 40 % , 30 % , 77 % and 88 % of the company \' s north american ammonia , uan , urea and methanol manufacturing capacity , respectively . the production of all four chemicals are heavily dependent on natural gas . phillips said " the latest data we had in october was that of the companies that we survey , which is not the entire ammonia market , but a good bit of it , we were looking at operating rates of 76 % . " currently , a total of 4 - 5 million tons / year of ammonia production capacity is out of service out of about 20 - 21 million tons / year of production capacity . " clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas [ rather than producing ammonia ] , " said nyiri . " it \' s the prudent thing to do , i think , in this marketplace . buy your ammonia if you can . at $ 9 gas , that costs you $ 350 / ton to make the ammonia , which is $ 145 more than the current market is willing to pay . " a spokeswoman for mississippi chemical said the company held on to its december gas contracts , and has been operating at varied levels of capacity throughout 2000 ( see daily gpi , june 30 ) . " depending on what the gas prices are , and what our product prices are around the january - february time frame , we will make decisions then on our operations rate [ capacity ] , " said melinda hood , a mississippi chemical spokeswoman . charles o . dunn , ceo of mississippi chemical , said , " we remain committed to the nitrogen business and our customers , but we also have to take advantage of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times . it is our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to be sustained during the intermediate term , " stated dunn . " as a result , we felt it was in the company \' s best interest to sell our futures positions to lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas prices . going forward , we will continue to determine operating levels for our plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices , nitrogen product prices and our customers \' requirements , as we have been doing for some time . " international imports are also hurting u . s . producers . currently , there is a surplus of ammonia in the international market , which is holding ammonia prices down . u . s . fertilizer producers can \' t compete with the international market . gas prices are 46 cents / mmbtu in russia , 50 cents to $ 1 / mmbtu in argentina and venezuela , and $ 1 / mmbtu in trinidad . the u . s . imports 5 . 5 million tons of ammonia each year . fertilizers represent 80 % of the demand for ammonia in the united states . terra industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it became economical again - - - whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and methanol prices rising , just as long as " prices reach levels allowing positive cash flows . " nyiri said he believes relief is in sight . he pointed out that the ammonia market has been sitting around the $ 205 / ton level for the last several months , but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next planting season . " i \' ve got my model peaking out around $ 250 / ton in april or may and at that time i have gas costs coming down . " at that point , the 1 - 2 bcf / d of demand from the fertilizer production industry should begin returning to service . - -', 'subject': 'update on ammonia shutdowns / terra chemical'}

{'body': 'strong demand holds load factors high despite alliance the introduction of the 1 . 325 bcf / d alliance pipeline into the north american gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western canada than expected , according to representatives of transcanada pipelines , pg & e gas transmission and alliance . extremely strong gas demand in the pacific northwest , california and in the midwest has produced continued high load factors on transcanada and pg & e gt - nw despite the presence of their huge new rival for western canadian supply . " the contract picture changed significantly on [ transcanada ] since the first of november and primarily at our empress , ab , delivery point into the transcanada mainline from the alberta pipe , but actual physical gas flows [ at about 6 bcf / d ] have not changed correspondingly , " said klaus exner , director of pipeline system operations at transcanada . " the big picture overview that i would give you is that demand is very high in the pacific northwest and california and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of alberta , through british columbia and into the pg & e systems . that hasn \' t let up at all and we don \' t foresee that letting up .

" transcanada \' s other major export route out of the western canadian sedimentary basin is the foothills and northern border route into the midwest . it also continues to operate at high load factors . " we didn \' t see a huge drop - off in physical flows post nov . 1 . we \' ve seen the it volumes come up considerably , " said exner . " the one thing that has changed is the volatility of the flows . customers are making frequent intraday nomination changes and we \' re seeing more up and down and day - to - day variations , according to the weather and the markets , than we would have when we had a higher firm contract level . the fluctuations are driven purely by the price differential between aeco and the dawn hub in ontario , which indicates whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not . " alliance pipeline spokesman jack crawford said the system has been running flat out at about 1 . 325 bcf / d since the valves were opened for commercial service dec . 1 . he also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase flows on the system . it has been estimated that alliance could increase gas flows to 1 . 5 bcf / d with existing compression . the additional capacity would be divided up among existing shippers , crawford said . " we haven \' t cranked up the system above the contract capacity yet . we probably won \' t do that for a couple weeks until we get things ironed out . frankly though , i \' m not sure chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the pacific northwest and california .

- cera alert cera alert : december 13 , 2000 title : california on the brink cera knowledge areas : western energy , n . american power , n . american gas california on the brink the california stalemate california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over credit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california \' s utilities , the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible . western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis , regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied the requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end their rate freezes , forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market . the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry . however , there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow , it is possible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws . in the six months since california \' s supply shortfall began plaguing western markets , regulators have done little to address the underlying problem . rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed , several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps , repeated changes to market rules , attempts to seize generator profits , and a challenging siting and permitting process . medicine worse than the illness several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms , but not the cause , of california \' s electric market woes . * * challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants , power plant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities . * price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market , especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state . * repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including the price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development . * calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange , the iso , and the ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the california markets , state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development . * facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust . cera \' s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west are not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants , decommissioning of older units , demand growth , and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors . california \' s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state . despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special , limited - term capacity payment , cera estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 . in addition , the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the earliest . therefore , three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage . the road to recovery there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall : * encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal some have been taken , such as new fast track approval , the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself . for now , there is still not enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ? * stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build . * move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence ( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with the market at a peak , however , now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move toward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if they end up above market , they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices , a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments . * encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although originally a feature of california \' s market design , most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response . * encourage market mechanisms that dampen the " boom bust " characteristic of the market . whether in the form of a capacity payment , a reserve requirement , or a minimum term portfolio requirement , the california power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate ) future price volatility . * avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to be restructured as described above , it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term contractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the market structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since july - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to do its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its course . * allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions . * free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa power plants that are operational , but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power . * * end * * this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours . this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

" california does [ not ] have the benefit of a competitive market , " chairman james hoecker said , noting he had heard the state \' s power market called " crisis by design . " the design was " an unworkable state law , the product of command and control that described in detail " exactly how the market should function . " it wasn \' t competition , " hoecker said . " it \' s time to get serious about saving the future of competitive markets . . . competition did not fail in principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never well - conceived or tried . this version of competition was a disaster . " commissioner william massey defended the federal energy regulatory commission \' s backing away from price caps . " rather than cap the spot market created by the state of california , the order would simply shrink its size and diminish its influence . " this will " give back participants \' ability to find the right price ; this ability is what california has taken away from that market . " massey said the action would allow bilateral transactions , support forward contracts , and allow the parties to manage risk . he urged the california public utilities commission to " step up to its responsibilities " in supporting the ferc - directed activities . massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the " apocalypse " in california " is absolutely staggering . the two largest utilities are virtually bankrupt .

{'body': 'out shippers condemn northwest \' s must - flow ofos several northern nevada industrial gas users have accused northwest pipeline of violating its tariff by holding them hostage to the daily must - flow operational flow orders ( ofos ) that it has issued since early december in an effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system . in a section 5 complaint filed friday , the industrial gas customers called on ferc to direct northwest to " cease and desist " the alleged violation of the tariff , which they claim is forcing them and other customers at the northern end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs of customers on the southern end of northwest \' s system . the effect of the must - flow ofos is to compel shippers to make up the capacity shortfall on northwest \' s system via displacement , the industrials noted . northwest \' s firm contractual demand is 720 , 000 dth / d , but its physical capacity is only 474 , 000 dth / d . pan - alberta gas ( u . s . ) inc . provides 144 , 000 dth / d through a displacement arrangement , while shippers are left to make up the remaining 102 , 000 dth / d . the industrial users contend they shouldn \' t be penalized for not complying with the must - flow ofos because northwest \' s tariff exempts shippers that have made " good faith efforts " to obtain gas supply , but have been unsuccessful . at issue is whether the " good faith efforts " applies to purchasing gas at reasonable costs , which is how the industrials interpret the tariff , or whether it means that shippers should be required to buy gas " at any price " to meet a must - flow ofo . the latter , according to the industrial users , is northwest \' s position . the " regulatory history " of northwest \' s tariff " makes clear that \' good faith efforts \' to obtain a gas supply at the stanfield [ or ] receipt point need not extend to purchasing \' gas at any price , \' but rather must be viewed in the context of current conditions and circumstances , i . e . available prices and supplies , " the industrial customers said . " where a shipper can secure gas needed to meet a must - flow order only at the basin price differentials that currently prevail , and assuming that the shipper can document such efforts and impacts for northwest verification , the shipper \' s request for exemption from penalties must be granted . " northwest twice has refused such a request by the industrial customers , they noted . in anticipation of the high gas prices this month , the nevada industrial users said they chose to switch to alternative fuels " where feasible " or to curtail operations rather than use their released capacity on northwest . nevertheless , the pipeline \' s daily must - flow ofos " have forced them into the volatile daily gas market to avoid extremely high non - compliance penalties , undermining their business decisions to rely on alternative fuels , " they told ferc [ rpol - 189 ] . in order to comply with northwest \' s orders , the industrials said they " must ship the gas to a point where they cannot use it , [ and ] can only sell it at the rocky mountain basin prices , which is a fraction of the price at which , under current conditions , they purchased it . " the industrial users said they have had to comply with northwest \' s must - flow ofos , given the hefty penalties they would face otherwise . the penalties are equal to the greater of $ 10 / dth or four times the highest spot rate at sumas , stanfield , kingsgate , opal or ignacio for the month of non - compliance . based on the spot rate at stanfield , the penalty this month was $ 58 . 15 / dth . if one of the nevada industrial users , newmont mining corp . , had defied northwest \' s order to flow 25 % of its contract demand , or 1 , 000 / dth , on any december day , it would have been penalized $ 58 , 160 for that one day , they said . if all of the nevada industrial customers had violated the pipeline \' s order , the one - day penalty would have been $ 149 , 471 . the industrial shippers want ferc to go beyond interpreting the " good faith efforts " exemption in their favor . they contend that northwest \' tariff allowing must - flow ofos " as currently structured " is both " unreasonable and unduly discriminatory . " that \' s because it requires one group of shippers , who see no additional benefits , to incur gas acquisition and transportation costs solely to subsidize service to another group of shippers , they argued . they believe the shippers who benefit should pay for the displacement capacity costs . currently , the must - flow ofos " result in southbound flows [ on northwest ] that create northbound capacity for the benefit of shippers with south - to - north entitlements . those same south - to - north shippers could , however , themselves purchase spot gas in the canadian supply areas and ship such volumes southward on an interruptible basis on northwest , i . e . do what [ the industrial ] shippers and others have been directed to do . they could pay the costs of the capacity that they want . " as an alternative , northwest could require a sharing of displacement capacity costs by all shippers using its system at a given time when capacity is short , or it could invest in facilities so that it has the physical capacity to meet all of its contractual commitments , the industrial users said .', 'subject': 'maybe tw should build into northern nevada . . . check this article'}

{'body': "el paso proceeding with nm pipe integrity testing el paso natural gas has received approval from the u . s . department of transportation ' s office of pipeline safety ( ops ) to conduct more internal inspections on its rebuilt new mexico pipeline , which ruptured august 19 killing 11 people ( see daily gpi , aug . 22 ) . since the explosion , flows through the line , which runs from west texas to california , have been reduced to 85 % capacity , or about 920 mmcf / d . ops said the el paso line has already been repaired and put through hydrostatic testing , which it passed . hydrostatic testing checks for cracks by forcing high - pressure water through the line . now el paso has the green light to begin smart pig testing , which will examine the internal integrity of the line . the device , called a pig because of the sound it makes during inspections , has sensors and once placed inside the line , it can detect dents , deformities and changes in wall thickness . neither ops nor el paso released a timetable as to when the pigging would occur or how long it would take . however , once the testing is completed , the results will be evaluated by ops , which then would determine if the line were safe for commercial use . ops has not issued actual regulations on smart pig use , but they have become increasingly sophisticated and more widely used . even though hydrostatic testing can actually detect certain flaws that are invisible to smart pigs , the pigging process is considered a complement to the water testing and ensures more integrity in test results . ops requires all pipe to undergo at least one hydrostatic test after construction . although not mandated , ops also has proposed requiring pipelines that transport liquid petroleum products to use direct assessment methods such as pigging to evaluate the pipeline ' s integrity . other types of inspections include using magnetic particles or ultrasound to measure the pipe wall ' s thickness . - -", 'subject': "update on el paso ' s nm pipeline testing"}

" it appears that if el paso kept the six . . . compressor stations on the line and implemented any necessary facility additions and modifications to integrate the converted line with its existing south system , it may be possible for el paso to increase its delivery capacity into california , " adamson said . he asked el paso to consider this option , given " the current difficult energy situation there [ in california ] and the consequent need to examine all possible options for substantive relief " of the situation .

{'body': 'american electric power buys houston pipe line american electric power thursday announced it has made a major move to expand its wholesale natural gas business in the southwest , agreeing to acquire the 2 . 4 bcf / d houston pipe line ( hpl ) along with the bammel storage field , one of the largest storage fields in north america , from enron . aep said since some details remain to be worked out , it was not disclosing the terms of the transaction at this time . aep will be acquiring the stock of hpl and it expects to complete the deal in the next couple months . hpl , one of the two original pipelines joined by enron chairman ken lay to form the company in the mid - 1980 s , has an extensive 4 , 400 mile transportation and gathering system through southern texas . the 118 bcf bammel field , located near the houston ship channel market area , has a 65 . 7 bcf working gas capacity and is known for its fast in and out capabilities . it has a 1 . 4 bcf / d peak withdrawal rate and a 365 mmcf / d injection capacity . " adding hpl to our natural gas asset portfolio will help us reach our goal of becoming a top - 10 gas trader and marketer , " said paul addis , executive vice president for aep . the company currently is second in the u . s . in electricity volume . " hpl will enhance aep \' s natural gas business with its multiple connections into the production areas of texas , its numerous interconnects with intrastate and interstate pipelines and its position in and around houston as a premier provider of natural gas . " aep , headquartered in columbus , oh , has numerous power generation plants in the midwest and southwest , including a number of gas - fired plants in texas . in 1998 it bought the louisiana intrastate gas ( lig ) system . john olson , energy analyst with sanders , morris & mundy in houston , said " for 55 years hpl has enjoyed a reputation as one of the strongest pipelines in the country . as a stand - alone operation it is first class . it \' s a very , very strong asset . " he said hpl has been showing losses of $ 50 million a year or more in recent years , " but those numbers are meaningless " because enron has been using it at discounted transportation rates to underpin its marketing efforts . olson said the sale is a continuation of enron \' s move to sell most of its hard assets and become a soft asset player . " they are emphasizing their trading . they are doing far better at trading . " for one houston - based risk manager , the sale of hpl by enron was a question of rate of return . the competition among intrastates in texas is fiercely competitive and for gas delivered to the houston ship channel it can be a game of half - cents , with a shipper on one of the multiple intrastates undercutting another to try to shave a profit , he said . enron recognized this and wanted out , he speculated . - -', 'subject': 'enron sells hpl and bammel'}

{'body': 'ca power market awaits bailout california power watchers were hoping for results early this week from the marathon government - industry negotiations . the principals of last tuesday night \' s marathon session were expected to meet by video - conference over the weekend to review solutions developed by staff working groups , which met through the end of the week . ( see daily gpi , jan . 11 ) on the west coast the week ended with emergency legislation starting its dash through the state capital , and the governor holding a 90 - minute meeting with two neighboring western governors to piece together a regional strategy on joint energy conversation / supply cooperation . on friday gov . gray davis said if ferc fails to act , he is sure congress will take up legislation to stabilize power prices throughout the country , " or at least give governors the option to opt into a stabilized pricing mechanism . sen . diane feinstein , d - ca , announced she was working on a bill to be offered later this month , which would allow the energy secretary to impose price caps . davis indicated that he and federal officials would be working over the weekend and he expects to have something to announce early next week , and in the long term he expects to " solve this problem in the next 90 days and in six months hopefully this whole episode will be a distant memory . " also on friday standard & poor \' s assigned an investment grade triple b - plus corporate credit rating to subsidiary pg & e energy trading holdings , and said subsidiaries gas transmission northwest and pe & g generating also would maintain their investment grade rating , based on each entity \' s own creditworthiness and economic self - sufficiency . these units would be insulated from any downgrades of the parent pg & e corp . , or the utility subsidiary , pacific gas & electric . this action came after pg & e suspended its fourth quarter dividend and announced it was cutting staff and services ( see daily gpi , jan . 12 ) . following their meeting in sacramento friday , gov . davis and his counterparts in oregon , john kitzhaber , and washington , gary locke , announced a feb . 2 western governors \' meeting would be held in portland , or , to push for a western region wholesale power price cap , and a region - wide push by each state to conserve energy and finally to share energy supplies on a seasonal basis . as fellow democrats , washington \' s gov . locke and oregon \' s gov . kitzhaber expressed strong support for gov . davis \' s efforts and pushed for solutions from ferc " it is extraordinarily important that this not be a partisan struggle between west coast democratic governors and the inland governors who are mostly republican , " said kitzhaber , noting that not all the solutions have to come from new generation . conservation can play a major role , too . both visiting governors said they strongly support the state of california becoming the purchaser of long - term power and then reselling to the utilities . they are banking on the fact that the state \' s creditworthiness will gain much better prices than the cash - strapped , near - bankrupt two major utilities , southern california edison co . and pacific gas and electric co . the lower house ( assembly ) of the state legislature cranked out about a dozen proposed laws , including one to completely restructure the oversight boards of the state - chartered grid operator ( cal - iso ) and wholesale spot power market ( cal - px ) from large stakeholder panels of 26 to 30 industry representatives to small units of three people each - - - all appointed by the governor . another proposed law would prevent the state \' s three major private - sector utilities , including the two near bankruptcy , to sell their remaining generation units , which are comprised mostly of nuclear , hydroelectric and interests in out - of - state coal - fired plants . gov . davis indicated he expects state lawmakers to pass the bill this wednesday , establishing three - person boards , and the members of the iso panel will be the head of the state \' s three principal agencies overseeing electricity - - - the california public utilities commission , california energy commission and electricity oversight board , of which two of the three are headed by davis appointees . the near - rolling blackouts of thursday , caused by storm - driven wave surges that curtailed power production at coastal plants , were eliminated over the weekend through stepped up conservation , restoration of major units at pg & e \' s diablo canyon nuclear generating plant , and by what the grid operator called " the biggest single - day " lowering of demand he has ever experienced . this week cal - iso expects to have 5 , 000 to 6 , 000 mw that were out of service last week back online , further improving the chance of avoiding power emergencies . salvaging the state \' s system last week at the critical stage three was california \' s water resources department , which operates the massive north - to - south network of aqueducts . it purchased 1 , 200 mw from out of state using the state \' s creditworthiness to get around the cal - iso financial problems . as it has done on a lower - profile basis in the past , the water resources department acted as a quasi - state power authority , and the cal - iso coo kellan fluckiger said that other market participants also are providing this sort of " intermediary financing " in light of the credit concerns surrounding the iso and utilities . the water department also contributed to the supply crunch - - - as it does routinely - - - by shutting down its heavy electricity consuming pumps that move massive quantities of water around the state . - -', 'subject': 'california update'}

{'body': 'breaking news : ca governor declares state of emergency posted 2 : 37 am ( cst ) jan 18 , 2001 late wednesday following a day of rolling blackouts and the prospect for more with electricity supplies drying up throughout the west , california gov . gray davis declared a state of emergency due to the power shortage and directed the state water resources department to begin securing power supplies for the beleaguered state grid . in making the bold move , gov . davis also announced that his conservation plan for state facilities and operations already has reached its goal of reducing energy use by more than 5 % . in the emergency proclamation , the governor said that electricity presently available through california three major investor - owned utilities is " insufficient to prevent widespread and prolonged disruptions of electric service , " and thus , he was ordering all state agencies to use their resources to do whatever they can to alleviate the power shortage . then he went on to specifically empower the water resources agency , which has been a key player in helping the state \' s transmission grid operator ( cal - iso ) narrowly avoid blackouts or avoid them being felt more pervasively throughout the state . noting that peak electrical loads for state buildings and institutions are on target for a 200 mw reduction and the water resources department peak pumping load has been reduced by 450 mw , gov . davis lauded californians for having " stepped up to the plate and dramatically reduced their appetite for electricity , " noting that the state already is 47 th in the nation among the lowest per - capita energy use and the state \' s electricity prices are the 10 th highest in the nation .', 'subject': 'calif governor declares state of emergency'}
{'body': 'el paso says it \' s open to expansion of system el paso natural gas " is willing to expand its system " to the california border if " sufficient support " for such a project can be demonstrated through long - term capacity contracts , the pipeline told ferc . the pipeline \' s comments were in response to a commission inquiry asking el paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed line 2000 crude - oil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline capacity crunch in the west . daniel m . adamson , director of ferc \' s office of energy projects , raised the prospect in a jan . 3 letter to el paso , saying that modifying the project " could assist the difficult situation " now facing the california gas market . specifically , the commission has recommended that el paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30 - inch diameter , 1 , 088 - mile crude oil pipeline from plains all american pipeline l . p . , and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service . the line extends from mccamey , tx , to bakersfield , ca . el paso plans to convert to gas service a 785 - mile segment from mccamey to ehrenberg , az . el paso proposed the line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression , and not as a system expansion . however , " there are several ways that an expansion could be accomplished , " wrote el paso vice president al clark on jan . 15 . " el paso could add compression to the proposed line 2000 project , or it could replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon in place . " as a third option , he said el paso could add new compression to its existing system or loop either the existing system or line 2000 project . the " preferable method will have to be determined by a careful analysis of the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity , i . e . where they want to put gas into el paso \' s system and where they want the gas delivered , " clark said . as a " first step " towards gauging market support for an expansion , he noted that el paso on jan . 12 posted 1 . 2 bcf / d of california - bound pipeline capacity for sale effective june 1 of this year . the capacity currently is held by affiliate el paso merchant energy , whose contracts expire may 31 . when the posting results are known , " el paso will determine whether another open season is needed to solicit expressions of interest in additional pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of california . " if el paso finds there is an " unmet demand for additional capacity " on its system , the pipeline at that time " will evaluate whether an expansion of the existing system or a modification of the line 2000 project , or both , is the appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion , " clark noted . in the meantime , he urged the commission to approve el paso \' s application for the line 2000 project as it was filed . not only will the project " increase the operational flexibility " of el paso \' s current system , but converting the line from oil to gas service will be a " necessary prerequisite " to any future expansion of the pipeline \' s system , according to clark .', 'subject': 'el paso responds to ferc on expansion potential'}

u = 35 & m = 2208 a feverish pitch the pace of regulatory and political events in california has taken on the feverish pitch of the energy market crisis itself . important decisions regarding a wide range of market structure issues are being made quickly at the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) and the state legislature , increasing the level of uncertainty most market participants already perceive in the quickly evolving california market . sudden changes are being made to the market structure , changes that used to require years in california  , s complex regulatory and legislative proceedings . as rolling blackouts have rippled through urban centers of northern california on january 17 and 18 , including in portions of downtown san francisco , sacramento , and the silicon valley , state officials are scrambling to set up the appropriate credit mechanisms to ensure the continued delivery of scarce western energy supplies to california  , s two largest utilities . even at prices near $ 800 per megawatt - hour ( mwh ) , the california department of water resources ( cdwr ) , attempting to buy power on behalf of pacific gas and electric ( pg & e ) and southern california edison ( sce ) , has been unable to secure enough to keep the lights on . in the mean time , legal actions by some energy suppliers threaten to tip the utilities into bankruptcy  * and are being held at bay only by direct intervention of california  , s governor . below is a summary of the various state actions being pursued concurrently : * california governor . california governor gray davis continues to attempt to act on behalf of pg & e and sce to secure long - term contracts for supply from merchant generation owners and marketers in california . on the same front , the governor has been negotiating with generators in an attempt to keep them from seeking compensation through the courts for energy delivered to the utilities . court - ordered reimbursement could prompt bankruptcy . * legislature . bills have been approved to authorize continued power purchases on behalf of pg & e and sce by the cdwr , to restructure the independent system operator  , s ( iso ) governing board to consist of five members appointed by the governor , to restrict the ability of the iso to enter into a broader interstate regional transmission organization ( rto ) without the explicit approval of california  , s electricity oversight board , and to prohibit the divestiture of the investor - owned utilities  , remaining generating assets until 2006 . the vehicle for pursuing authorization of state bond financing for acquisition of transmission assets and construction of new generation facilities is still being developed . * california public utilities commission . on january 18 the cpuc adopted a decision prohibiting the sale of sce  , s mohave generating station to aes . this voids a sale that was announced but not closed . the cpuc also delayed decisions regarding sce  , s application to end its rate freeze and the prudency criteria for utilities entering into long - term supply contracts . some of these issues will continue to evolve as they progress along their respective and sometimes intersecting paths , and some will need to pass through multiple review bodies . this rapid and erratic evolution has not helped to decrease either the financial risk associated with supplying energy to california  , s two largest utilities , or the level of uncertainty in developing new generation to supply california in the future . the iso anticipates that it will call stage 3 emergencies ( reserves less than 1 . 5 percent ) for january 19 and will most likely continue to curtail interruptible customers through the weekend . western energy supplies are being strained by recent heavy usage of hydroelectric facilities where water supplies are already as much as 25 percent below average , owing to low precipitation and continued plant outages near 9 , 000 mw in california . the gravity of the financial condition of california  , s two largest utilities is exemplified by the need for other , more creditworthy intermediaries , including california municipal utilities , state agencies , and some unregulated energy suppliers , to act as temporary guarantors for the acquisition of energy on behalf of pg & e and sce . * * end * * follow above url for full report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit http : / / www 20 . cera . com / ceraweek / e - mail category : alert cera knowledge area ( s ) : western energy , to make changes to your cera . com account go to : forgot your username and password ?

{'body': 'storage information , etc . bush administration extends emergency supply orders despite recent indications that the bush administration would take a more hands - off approach to the california crisis , energy secretary spencer abraham late yesterday gave pg & e and southern california edison another two weeks of breathing room by extending emergency orders requiring gas and power suppliers to continue supplying the cash - strapped utilities . the emergency gas order now expires at 3 a . m . ( est ) feb . 7 . in granting the extensions , abraham urged the state to get to work to solve its own problems . he said only california can implement the policies necessary to resolve the short - term and long - term supply challenges . " our action today is designed to give the governor , the california legislature and other relevant parties the time to take necessary action . i strongly urge the parties to act immediately , " said abraham . he also said he was keenly aware that other western states have expressed concerns about their own supply situation and the impact the order is having on power prices in their areas . despite the action , pg & e said it still is having trouble getting gas suppliers to comply with the emergency order originally issued jan . 19 . " the gas supply situation is [ not good ] , " utility spokeswoman staci homrig said yesterday afternoon . " we are quickly depleting our storage . even under the order , j . aron & co . [ a subsidiary of goldman sachs ] has not delivered gas . they represent about 9 % of our daily needs ( 1 . 5 bcf / d in january ) . " oh yeah , we \' ve been in contact with them , " she said . " we \' ve been in contact with the doe , too . the other two suppliers who had stopped delivering gas to us last week have made gas available to us under the order . they are sempra energy trading and western gas resources . " homrig said pg & e expected doe to take legal action against those who didn \' t resume deliveries . the order applied to 27 gas suppliers , all of which supplied gas to pg & e within the last 30 days . " there \' s not a lot i can say , " said j . aron spokeswoman kate baum . " j . aron has always complied with the law and we intend to comply with this order . that \' s my statement . i can neither confirm nor deny anything else . " meanwhile , other suppliers who were not among those on the doe \' s list , were staying as far away from california as possible . " all i know is we \' re not selling in california any more . a person could get fired around here for doing that , " said one marketer . " all we had in california were a few spot deals that expired at the end of december . needless to say we didn \' t re - up them . " without the doe \' s order , pg & e would be back where it was last week , with some suppliers stopping delivery , others planning to stop at the end of their contract terms and most suppliers unwilling to sell additional gas to the utility . pg & e has said it has enough gas in storage to make up for the lost supply under such a scenario until the first week in february . homrig said pg & e \' s storage currently is well below 50 % full , or less than 16 bcf and depleting rapidly by about 500 mmcf / d to 1 bcf / d . pg supplies remain tight depending on your perspective , california either moved toward future solutions to its nagging energy crisis or took several steps backward yesterday with the launch of its electricity bulk buying program for long - term , fixed - price supplies . the auction began yesterday and will run through noon today . the state is seeking sealed bids for six - month , three - year , five - year and 10 - year supply agreements . whether results of the auction would be made public was still unclear yesterday , but the results are expected to be given to legislators , who now are debating various long - term solutions in the state senate . a spokesperson in the state assembly speaker \' s office said the legislature is basically " standing by , " awaiting more price information . action on the proposed comprehensive legislation , including the question of the state taking over the private utilities \' hydroelectric systems , should come by the end of the week . merrill lynch said yesterday it was " increasingly skeptical " that the " securitization for hydro " plan would go forward . it has received " muted support , " merrill lynch said , and has not been drafted as a bill yet . recent revisions of the comprehensive bill show some progress on contract flexibility , with the possibility that the value of the entire portfolio of energy contracts might be capped at a weighted average price of $ 55 / mwh , which is well below the utilities retail rate caps ( edison at $ 72 . 40 / mwh and pg & e at $ 66 ) . the difference is expected to be used to pay down the utilities \' debt . meanwhile , the electric system limped along under the specter of another stage three yesterday , but without rolling blackouts , and elsewhere indications outside the state were that some energy marketers have written off california from their prospective marketing lists . " we \' re not selling in california any more , a person could get fired for doing that around here , " said one texas - based gas marketer , referring to the continuing credit problems of pacific gas and electric co . , which has been hobbled by the weight of its wholesale electricity debts on the natural gas side , too . in the meantime , southern california edison co . is back in federal district court in los angeles , where it obtained a favorable initial ruling two weeks ago . this time it is asking for the court to force the california public utilities commission to allow it to raise its rates to cover the wholesale cost of power . calling the action with the court " a last resort , " edison said it has tried to get the rate situation resolved , but at every turn it has met " resistance , denial and finger - pointing " by the cpuc \' s five - member governor - appointed board . the cpuc on tuesday acted to anticipate new state legislation regarding the hydroelectric systems in the state by canceling hearings it had scheduled this week and next to go exclusively to written comments for the environmental review of the ongoing case looking at pg & e \' s hydro utility assets . " the current energy crisis in the state makes it prudent for the commission to shift from public hearings to written testimony , " the cpuc said in a prepared statement .', 'subject': "i ' m sure you guys have seen most of this , but may pick up some"}

" tom hannigan , director of the state water resource department who oversaw the auction , said the state obtained " a useful sample across all times of the day across the spectrum of the year , and we are quite pleased with the initial results . i look forward to looking through bids and developing some long - term contracts . our fundamental responsibility here is to purchase power at the best possible prices for consumers and businesses . " on wednesday as the bids from the internet - based auction were initially accessed , davis said he expected a new law from the state legislature by feb . 1 , giving the state authority to consummate deals involving the best of the bids received in the quick - turnaround auction . the bids covered six - month , three - , five - and 10 - year durations . hearings in sacramento continued on the omnibus new law ( s ) that would give the state long - term buying authority , and also decide how to handle operation of the utility hydroelectric generation system and over - market purchased power contracts with so - called " qualifying facilities " ( qfs ) . bidders , utilities and other market participants expressed initial enthusiasm for the state \' s new program , with san diego - based sempra \' s ceo telling the financial community thursday that he is " encouraged " by the state auction . " we don \' t yet have detailed information on the bids in the first round - - - and in my opinion that \' s what it is , a first round - - - but from what the governor has said , i am quite encouraged that we are going to see power allocated to the three utilities at below the costs that they have recently been paying in the wholesale power market , " said sempra \' s stephen baum . " that should ease the financial situation of all three utilities and give us greater liquidity , opening the way to further measures being discussed , such as securitization of uncollected balances . " california \' s governor also pushed ahead on several other fronts , announcing three new energy - related advisors plucked from the public and private sectors : mike peevey , a former utility president turned - successful - energy startup entrepreneur ; s . david freeman , general manager of the nation \' s largest municipal utility and a veteran of more than four decades in public power ; and frank zarb , nasdaq stock market ceo and a former top - level energy adviser in presidents nixon and ford administrations in washington , d . c . in the 1970 s . peevey , whose wife was elected to the state legislature in november , will serve as davis \' s energy adviser ; freeman will help the state water resources department develop long - term power contracts and zarb will advise davis on energy finance and market issues . also on wednesday , davis announced the newly created five - member politically appointed board for the state - chartered transmission grid operator ( cal - iso ) held its first meeting . it replaces a 26 - member industry stakeholder board that davis has regularly criticized for representing energy companies rather than consumers . the new members include close aides to the governor , such as his business / transportation cabinet - level secretary , head of the state electricity oversight board , and his senior policy adviser , along with a veteran consumer group attorney and the chief staff person at the silicon valley manufacturing group . a california - based spokesperson for duke , tom williams , confirmed that his company participated in the auction and that its bids are " all contingent on coming to agreeable credit terms .

storage levels within california are again at critically low levels . the mild weather during december and early january allowed some improvement in the positions , but when pg some plants have simply curtailed operations in response to the higher prices . on the power side , plants within california are extremely limited in their ability to burn alternative fuels because of emissions credits . however , plants outside of california do have some backup capability . arizona public service has purchased 400 , 000 barrels of 1 % sulfur residual fuel oil to burn as an alternative to gas . given the intense pressure on gas , oil will absorb some of growth in power loads . california in november an early strong draw on storage in california raised questions about winter deliverability within the state . a combination of low storage inventories , high gas demand for power generation , and continued high utilization rates on import pipelines into the state will keep pressure on california prices through february ( see table 6 ) . despite efforts by end users to limit gas burns in the state in the face of extremely high gas prices , cera expects demand during january in the state is up by 650 mmcf per day on a year - over - year basis . in february , loads should start to decline as residential and commercial demand declines through the month . however , power loads will remain strong and actually climb from january into february as hydroelectric generation falls . this demand support , continued strong capacity utilization rates in import pipelines into california , and critically low storage inventories will keep intense pressure on gas prices within the state through february . during periods of high demand , prices will likely reach back up into the $ 15 . 00 to $ 20 . 00 per mmbtu range . eventually , as heating loads settle and storage draws slow toward the end of february , differentials should ease back into the $ 1 . 00 to $ 3 . 00 per mmbtu range . on balance , cera expects a topock differential for february of $ 3 . 00 per mmbtu ( see table 7 ) . pacific northwest three factors have combined to strengthen malin prices over the past week , and these forces should extend price strength at malin into february . first , the return of colder winter weather after moderate temperatures during late december and early january is increasing heating loads and power loads . second , lower - than - normal hydroelectric generation is increasing the draw on gas for power generation during a season when the pull is normally low . third , the california power shortage is drawing on all regional supplies and supporting the demand for gas for power generation . pacific northwest demand is expected to hold flat relative to january levels during february with slight increases in gas demand for power generation offsetting declines in residential and commercial demand . the sustained high demand levels  * despite relatively healthy northwest storage inventory levels  * will keep malin prices well above henry hub prices . cera expects a malin to henry hub differential of $ 1 . 00 per mmbtu during february . a drop - off in demand of 200 mmcf per day is expected in march , as steep declines in heating loads offset continued increases in gas demand for power generation . however , prices at malin will likely remain unusually strong this spring . part of the shortfall in hydroelectric generation continues to be made up by draining reservoirs . that early drawdown will limit the availability of hydroelectric generation through the spring and early summer months . both low hydroelectric generation and a challenging storage refill season in northern california should sustain the malin premium to the henry hub even into the spring . rocky mountains the volatility in rocky mountain differentials continues . differentials continue to depend primarily on local heating loads ; cooler weather supports loads and prices within the region , but periods of warm weather drive steep declines in rocky mountain prices relative to prices at the henry hub . during february , demand should drop off in the region . although declines in heating loads in neighboring western regions will be offset by increases in gas demand for power generation , the rockies remain primarily coal based . as a result , the lower expected hydroelectric output will do little to support loads within the region . increases in supply  * cera expects supply increases of 300 mmcf per day during 2001 relative to 2000  * will overwhelm available pipeline capacity out of the region . demand during february in the rockies is expected to remain flat at 2 . 9 bcf per day ; however , within the month demand loads will drop substantially . this will put pressure on differentials toward the end of the month , and cera expects average basis differentials to the henry hub during february of $ 0 . 75 per mmbtu . that widening trend should continue during march , with differentials to the henry hub eventually reaching $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu this summer . southwest prices in the san juan basin have been following rocky mountain prices up and down with regional demand loads . that dynamic will likely continue through february . cera expects relatively flat demand during february within the southwest . as in the west as a whole , a significant drop - off is expected during march as residential and commercial heating demand wanes . for february , continued strong demand loads within the rockies and southwest will support prices in the san juan , barring unusually warm weather . cera expects a differential to the henry hub of $ 0 . 65 per mmbtu . as residential and commercial loads decline sharply during late february and march , prices in the san juan will reflect ample supply . cera expects declines in san juan production during 2001 , but declines will be limited by the strongest drilling activity for conventional supplies in the basin in a decade . however , pressure on rocky mountain supplies will mean increased exports from the north into the san juan , and those increased exports will more than offset the declines in local production . pipeline capacity constraints out of the san juan will again mean wide san juan - to - henry hub differentials , with pressure on prices developing during the spring and intensifying through the summer months . western canada : increasing supply aeco differentials to the henry hub have ranged between $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu and over $ 1 . 00 per mmbtu . given strong demand in the united states , export pipelines have been running near capacity all winter . even the 1 . 3 bcf per day alliance pipeline has been running full ; through the end of the winter , continued strong us demand should keep export pipeline flows near capacity . given these flow levels , cera expects differentials to remain near the $ 0 . 60 to $ 1 . 00 per mmbtu level , reflecting the cost of transport on transcanada , the only available export capacity out of alberta . for february , cera expects a differential between aeco and the henry hub of $ 0 . 65 per mmbtu . storage inventories in western canada are running below historical average levels , but the refill season should be manageable ; inventories are nowhere near as low as us inventory levels . inventories in the west are expected to fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal season , and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injection season begins in the spring . cera expects differentials to henry hub prices to narrow sometime in the late spring as the focus in alberta turns from filling us winter demand to refilling canadian storage . on the supply side , production has turned the corner in western canada , and year - over - year increases in supply of nearly 300 mmcf per day are now evident . after flat production levels for 2000 relative to 1999 , increases for the year 2001 should reach 350 mmcf per day . given strong expected demand from california and the west coast , cera expects no declines in year - over - year flows into the west on pge gt nw . overall flows should reach 2 . 4 bcf per day for 2001 , an increase of 85 mmcf per day from 2000 levels . * * end * * follow above url for full report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit http : / / www 20 . cera . com / ceraweek / e - mail category : monthly briefing cera knowledge area ( s ) : western energy , to make changes to your cera . com account go to : forgot your username and password ? go to : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / client / forgot this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

{'body': 'cpuc votes to keep gas flowing a special session yesterday of california \' s regulators gave pg & e \' s utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past feb . 7 when the current federal doe emergency order expires , but it postponed action on another pg & e request that southern california gas co . - - - which has strongly objected - - - be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the pg & e utility \' s residential and small business customers . loretta lynch , president of the california public utilities commission , said pg & e \' s utility is a " victim - - - a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers , " now demanding payment for future supplies up front - - - not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills , but because the electricity crisis has sapped its credit - worthiness . the cpuc action allows pg & e \' s utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or , in effect , a lien , in the utility \' s retail customers \' bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with pg & e \' s gas utility operations while the credit - worthiness of the company itself is dubious . it won \' t be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts , that it will know if the cpuc action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation , according to pg & e gas utility spokesperson staci homrig . on the operational side , pg & e on wednesday declared a low - inventory ofo because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system . the action was thought to help cause the pg & e citygate price to jump from $ 11 to $ 17 on wednesday . as for reports of low storage , homrig said that while the utility \' s supplies are very low , they are adequate for the next week . they are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point , homrig said . lynch said that pg & e has not defaulted on any payments , but nevertheless , in what she considers predatory practices , the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided . " these gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh , " lynch said in voting for the securitization measure . " suppliers who have been paid when due , are now saying regardless of existing agreements \' pay us today . \' they are doing this in the coldest time of the year , so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow pg & e amend these agreements in order to keep the gas flowing . " part of the cpuc \' s action places a 90 - day limit on the securitization option , so with the way gas contracts work , in effect , it only provides about another 30 days \' worth of supplies , said homrig , who noted that almost all of pg & e \' s 25 to 30 suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements ( advances , cash - on - delivery or letters of credit ) that the company cannot accommodate because of its cash - flow crisis . ~ out of ongoing negotiations , the parties came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables , thus , assuring them they will get paid . on the gas side , pg & e has had sufficient revenues - - - unlike its electric business - - - but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a normal payment arrangement because of the severe credit - rating decline in the past weeks . the cpuc met in san francisco late wednesday afternoon in the midst of a whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor , state legislature , consumer groups , regulators and utilities . a key piece was missing , however . california state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy crisis . reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy business . a spokesman for the assembly speaker \' s office said he had no idea when the briefing would be re - scheduled . one piece of legislation that got through the state senate ( sb lx ) yesterday authorizes another $ 500 million in emergency funds to purchase power . it also would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities \' wholesale power supplier under long - term contracts at least through 2002 . the measure drew a protest from cpuc commissioner richard bilas , who argued that the state agency be " removed from that role as quickly as possible . " the bill , which was first passed by the state assembly , was returned to assembly committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate . it then would have to be ratified again by the assembly . meanwhile , consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the state bail - out of the private - sector utilities . this prompted at least one of the utilities , southern california edison , to come out swinging , saying that the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any " windfall profits " or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent company . a letter surfaced in washington from gov . gray davis to the senate energy and natural resources committee , dated jan . 30 and outlining measures the state is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand , sign long - term contracts and maintain the financial viability of the state \' s public utilities . the letter , a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported here , contained no specifics on any long - term contracts nor legislation signed that would address the immediate problem . davis outlined measures being taken to speed up siting of new power plants , saying an additional 2 , 000 mw would be online by the end of the year . responding to questions on another arena , edison international \' s senior vice president tom higgins said " everything is on the table " in the ongoing negotiations between davis \' three - person negotiating team and the two utilities , including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in los angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities \' own generation against the whopping wholesale power cost under - collections . the state remained under a power watch for the 16 th day as the california independent grid operator ( cal - iso ) urged conservation because " reserves remain very low .

cera alert title : california \' s desperate attempts to avoid a rate increase url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2241 california  , s desperate attempts to avoid a rate increase on february 1 , 2001 , the california assembly approved and the california governor signed a new law intended to secure power supplies for california . the legislature has been meeting since early january in a  & special extraordinary session  8 to address the power market crisis in the state , and the new law represents their first significant piece of legislation . the bill , ab 1 , establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the state  , s businesses and consumers . whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the limited revenue source used to pay for the power  * collected by the state  , s investor - owned utilities ( ious ) under current retail rates  * will cover wholesale power market costs incurred by the state . the law reflects the obsession by california lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on the underlying flaws in california  , s market structure . ab 1 ushers in several important changes to the california market structure . it also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the state . highlights of the bill include * power buying authority transferred . the responsibility for purchasing power for the customers of california  , s ious has been transferred to the california department of water resources ( cdwr ) . the california utilities will continue to operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts . the difference between the utilities  , total load and the sum of their resources ( referred to as the utilities  ,  & net short  8 amount ) will be supplied by cdwr , an amount of energy that varies between 5 , 000 and 25 , 000 megawatts ( mw ) , depending on the time of year , time of day , and utility plant availability . the utilities most recently performed this function themselves , buying energy from the california power exchange ( px ) . however , cdwr has been buying electricity on behalf of the ious since mid - january , when the near - bankruptcy of southern california edison ( sce ) and pacific gas & electric ( pg & e ) threatened to disrupt supplies to their customers . cdwr is a state agency that manages water reservoirs and transportation systems in the state . cdwr uses an enormous amount of electricity to transport water across california and provides critical load - shedding capability to the independent system operator ( iso ) . in addition , cdwr  , s reservoirs generate power . the cdwr is thus well integrated in the state  , s electric grid but in the past has not executed large , complicated energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of california  , s utilities . * portfolio of transactions . the intent of ab 1 is to allow cdwr to execute a portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and their customers . cdwr has until january 2 , 2003 , to execute contracts . cdwr will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse . it has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms , including monthly , annual , two - year , three - year , and longer . cdwr may also enter into options . thus , although cdwr  , s role is intended to be temporary , the contracts that it executes could extend many years . * power for munis . cdwr may purchase power on behalf of some california municipal utilities at the municipal utilities  , election . * new payment scheme . cdwr will be entitled to a portion of existing utility rates to pay for the cost of purchased power , interest on bonds , and administrative expenses . this payment stream will be equal to the difference between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates ( averaging about $ 0 . 07 per kilowatt - hour kwh ) and the utilities  , costs to run their own generation plants , costs of bilateral and qualifying facility contracts , and the costs of ancillary services . the cdwr share of retail rates is referred to as the california purchase adjustment ( cpa ) . it is not clear whether the cpa will cover wholesale power market costs . current prices for multiyear power contracts may lie above the cpa . in addition , if investors believe that the cpa is inadequate to cover costs , the entire program may be abandoned . * new bonds . bonds will be issued to secure power . the total amount of bonds issued may not exceed four times the cpa . the state will transfer $ 500 million from the general fund to jump - start the program , which begins immediately . this seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by cdwr from the california utilities  , customers ( and municipal utilities if they opt in ) . * new residential rate freeze . the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it has completed paying all outstanding obligations . this locks in the recent 9 percent residential rate increase indefinitely . governor gray davis thus keeps his pledge not to increase rates further . * retail competition . to help secure a stable payment stream for the new bonds , ab 1 enables the cpuc to prohibit the utilities  , retail customers from choosing an alternative electricity provider until cdwr  , s obligations are paid . although the cpuc has yet to act on this , the action would effectively halt the competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the cdwr program . * taxpayer protection . ab 1 directs that the new bonds clearly state  & neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of california is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond .  8 thus , the bonds are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates . * no assets affected . the cdwr is granted neither ownership nor control of utility assets . ironically , the authority now granted cdwr is what california utilities had essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions . the utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts . in addition , the utilities have more experience to perform this function than cdwr . rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices , california has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function . sce and pg & e are still left to contend with uncollected costs from past energy purchases , although they will no longer incur costs associated with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates . the utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved . it is not clear whether the law  , s prohibition on rate increases for residential customers can be achieved . the law is silent on rate increases for commercial and industrial customers , providing a potential path for recovering higher - than - expected costs . alternatively , cdwr could conceivably find contracts of sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met . these contracts would lock in today  , s retail rates for a long period of time . ab 1 is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the power system in california to a more stable footing . key tasks remain . * california  , s wholesale market structure , which helped cause the supply crisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in california , remains unchanged . the term contracts cdwr is likely to sign will provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will not be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities . in addition , california  , s siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged . * the state must still address the need to expedite the development of new power plants . * ab 1 does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale energy costs of california  , s utilities . the state has been negotiating a deal with the utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission assets to the state . however , the utilities have achieved recent court victories that may pave the way to a court - directed recovery of these costs . recent audits indicate that sce and pg & e recovered their stranded costs early in 2000 , which should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes . a legal showdown between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable . * * end * * follow above url for full report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 -

{'body': 'i wanted to share some great news with you about a major corporate initiative within ets , called the ibuyit project , that you should know about and be looking forward to . ibuyit is a tool that will make it easier for you to purchase the things you need to get your job done and / or to operate our business . some key points related to ibuyit are : ? employees at all levels across ets will be able to access ibuyit on their computers much like the enron intranet . ibuyit provides an upgrade to the existing b 2 b web - based procurement tool . ? ibuyit will utilize a new catalog system ( requisite ) that will make it easier for you to identify material items and incorporate them into the requisition . ? ibuyit will not only make it simple for you to buy on - line , but it can also serve as your single , convenient source to access other tools and information you use everyday at enron . stan horton , rod hayslett , and phil lowry decided back in december that ets would take the lead by being the first business unit to begin working with global strategic sourcing ( gss ) , who is developing ibuyit . both field and houston - based ets employees have been involved with ibuyit efforts to - date to help determine how ibuyit can best be used to support our employees and our business . more of you will be involved as the ibuyit project progresses . ibuyit will be deployed to ets , corporate , ebs , ees , and ews in a phased approach during the first three quarters of 2001 . starting in april , ibuyit will be available to certain groups of ets employees for the purchase of office supplies and travel . ibuyit will be implemented on a full scale across ets in july . those of you in engineering may be aware of the ongoing mlrp efforts and may be wondering about the impact of ibuyit . because of the unique nature of its business , engineering has decided to continue moving forward with mlrp . but , we will also continue to explore ways for ibuyit to complement mlrp and benefit engineering  , s business . as the person ultimately responsible for ibuyit  , s success within ets , i wanted to share my enthusiasm with you as early as possible about ibuyit . in addition to what i already mentioned , ibuyit strongly supports ets  , s existing procurement and supply management strategy , will allow the company to save money by taking advantage of its relationships with preferred suppliers , and will help us to achieve a greater return on our investments in cutting - edge technology . as you can tell , there are many strong reasons for all of us within ets to be excited about ibuyit . so , stay tuned . you may be asked to actively participate in ibuyit efforts , but i guarantee that you will have many opportunities to hear and learn more about ibuyit in the coming months . you will also have many opportunities to have your questions answered and opinions heard - starting here . if you have any questions or comments , simply reply to this e - mail - i will appreciate hearing from you . morris brassfield senior director operations support services ( 713 ) 646 - 7006', 'subject': 'ibuyit project'}

" whatever options we come up with for 1 , 2 , and 3 , we will always have to offer 4 as well . susan and steve stojic : please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated rate options and stick to them . otherwise , this negotiated rate approach could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations ( like a 7 yr , 231 day contract at $ . 51764 , for example ) . i \' m not sure that would be a bad thing , but we need to think about it . we need to be sure we can tell a customer " no " and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for the 5 yr term and the $ . 35 rate , for example . i think we can lay out options of our choosing and then enforce a " no substitutions " policy ( this is sticking with the " cafeteria " theme ) but we need to be sure . q . 3 . if we can use the " cafeteria options " approach , how much flexibility do we have in structuring the options ? a : this one is hard . we need to be sure that the price and term we choose to offer for options 1 - 3 is solely within our discretion . we don \' t want to be second guessed by ferc as to whether we should have offered option 1 at $ . 58 instead of $ . 60 . susan and steve : if you guys confirm that we have discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options , does that mean we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better deal than the recourse option ( for most shippers ) ? i . e . , could we deliberately incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals - - i . e . , by offering options 1 - 3 at $ . 55 , $ . 45 and $ . 40 instead of the $ . 60 , $ . 45 , and $ . 35 shown above . i suspect that is what guardian and the other pipes did to obtain 100 % subscription under neg . rate deals . q . 4 . how do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply ? ? ? a . ideally , we \' d be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it the way we \' d prefer to sell it . under the above example , assuming stan , danny and steve decide short term deals are better , what if we get 100 mm / d of offers on each of the 4 rate / term options described above . that \' s 400 mm / d of demand for a 150 mm / d project . can we sell 100 to the guys who want option 1 ( $ . 60 / 5 yrs ) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr / $ . 45 guys ? that really hoses the recourse bidders . do we have to cover the recourse demand first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else ? pro rata to everyone ? under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation , pro rata to everyone may be the right answer . or at least its the answer until we \' ve filled the recourse rate guys \' orders , then we can give the remaining capacity to the neg . rate guys whose bids we value most highly ( using some objective nondiscriminatory calculation of course ) . ugh . susan and steve - - please take a crack at questions 2 - 4 . i think 1 is answered already . i haven \' t done any research yet , so maybe these questions are easier than they currently seem to me . get me and mkm on the phone at your convenience to discuss . we \' ve gotta move quick so the marketers can get out and sell this stuff . df', 'subject': 'tw expansion'}

{'body': 'note the discussion on market share halfway through the article . top gas gorillas show strong volume growth the year 2000 was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing , with huge increases in gas prices , enormous volatility , continuing growth in sales volumes and major potential for profits . physical gas sales volumes for the top 20 marketers in ngi \' s ranking grew 17 % to nearly 150 bcf / d , and profits among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as williams reporting 2 , 000 % profit increases in their energy merchant segments . however , for many of the smaller players it was a tough year . " the big news here is probably the price pressure the marketers have had to withstand , " said ben schlesinger , president of maryland - based consulting firm schlesinger and associates , which tracks energy marketing . " these people have price exposure on both sides of their business : the buy side and sell side . they \' ve actively sought to hedge these risks , but there \' s no question that there have been some real stresses in their businesses as a result of quadrupling gas prices in 2000 . " significant shuffling has begun to take place and will continue , not just among the leadership but among the whole roster of 500 marketing companies , predicted schlesinger . " for the first time i \' m not sure all 500 will make it because of the price volatility , and the stresses that it creates on their balance sheets and their ability to meet the different needs of their customers . " if you are on the wrong side of a transaction these days in california , you are going to suffer significantly . it \' s not much different at the henry hub either , he noted . the harsh reality is that only the strong will survive . ronald j . barone of ubs warburg believes the california energy crisis and fears of lack of gas supply and capacity are driving customers to the strongest marketers . " i think that over the long term it will be a positive for the bigger players , such as enron . customers want to go with somebody who is big , has facilities , somebody who is going to guarantee it , somebody who can do risk management for them . enron is the 800 - pound gorilla here . " enron has been the 800 - pound gorilla in gas marketing for years but there were always plenty of 750 - pound gorillas around . last year , however , enron found a way to trade natural gas over the internet and at last glance was well over 1 , 600 pounds , more than double the size of its next closest rival gorilla , duke energy . enron sold 23 . 8 bcf / d of gas last year compared to only 13 . 3 bcf / d the year prior and compared to the 11 . 9 bcf / d sold by duke energy , which came in second place in ngi \' s ranking of gas marketers by physical sales volume . enron catapulted itself to the next level with the help of its handy new tool , enrononline , its web - based proprietary energy and commodity trading system that now handles about 3 , 000 mainly natural gas transactions each day . in 2000 , enron completed its first full year of deploying enrononline , which quickly became the world \' s largest web - based e - commerce site . during the year , enron executed 548 , 000 transactions online with 3 , 000 customers , totaling $ 336 billion of gross value . the tremendous success of enrononline led many observers to wonder whether market concentration was beginning to take place in the industry . when you look at enron \' s massive increase in wholesale transactions you have to wonder about that concentration . enron \' s 23 . 8 bcf / d is pretty large ( 35 % ) when compared with the 69 bcf / d that is actually consumed in north america . but you have to factor in multiple trades - - - one marketer trades a given molecule of gas to another marketer and so on . according to schlesinger , the so - called " churning factor " is close to three . " in the past several years when we \' ve been polling marketers , we got numbers ( in 1999 ) that came to about 60 tcf . we added up all the physical sales by all the marketing companies . we did not have 100 % response in our survey - - - some of the mid - sized and smaller companies didn \' t respond . we reasonably extrapolated that about 65 tcf , maybe even 70 tcf of gas was traded each year in north america . physical consumption in north america is about 25 tcf so 70 divided by 25 is about 2 . 8 . " using that calculation , enron with 23 . 8 bcf / d of physical gas sales in 2000 ends up with a not unreasonable 12 % market share . when the federal trade commission looks at markets and market share , it uses several tools , one of which is the herschman - herfindahl index , a measure of market concentration . it \' s the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant . if one company owns the entire 100 % of the market , that \' s an hhi of 10 , 000 . the department of justice has been using 1 , 800 as a red flag when it considers approval of mergers and acquisitions . according to schlesinger , the total gas industry has an hhi of only about 200 , way below any suggestion of market concentration . " it \' s so low that it \' s unbelievable . it \' s a highly competitive business . even if one competitor has 12 % of the market ( hhi of 144 ) and the next competitor has 6 % and on down , it certainly doesn \' t send up any red flags , " he said . " it could be that market concentration in the gas industry has risen a bit in 2000 , but this information alone would not diminish the fact that the industry is one of the most competitive businesses in the united states . however , there may be some regional issues we have to think about , " he added . " we haven \' t looked at that , so i can \' t comment on whether anyone has undue market power in a particular region or state , for example . " there is a snowball effect going on among the top marketers . the leaders keep getting larger . volume growth averages at least 10 % per year or more . several factors should fuel future growth . price increases , volatility and uncertainty of supplies are driving buyers to the larger marketers , according to both schlesinger and barone . online trading has become a new springboard for additional growth by allowing greater efficiency and many more trades to take place . schlesinger said he believes electronic trading was responsible for a good part the 17 % increase in volumes . enron attributed much of its growth to the online business . according to some observers , online trading still has plenty of room to grow . altra energy ceo paul bourke believes about 30 % of all gas trading now takes place over the internet . bourke said altra had 8 , 000 natural gas trades on its system in december . however barone predicts there eventually will be a slowdown in gas marketing growth in the united states as international energy markets grab the attention of many marketers . " international should pick up the slack and contribute increasingly to the bottom line , " he said . barone also expects the current market situation and the continued interest in service , supply and commodity versatility to continue driving marketing companies together . " i think size , scope and scale are incredibly significant . " only one of the top 20 major marketers last year resulted from the combination of two separate predecessors : axia , which grew out of the combination of koch energy and entergy . the rest of the group achieved its growth without major acquisitions or mergers . thirteen out of the 20 top marketers showed double - or triple - digit volume growth with only two companies in the minus column . pg & e had the largest volume deterioration of any of the large marketers with a 40 . 1 % decline in annual volumes and a 42 % decline in quarterly volumes . pg & e went through a significant reorganization last year . the move of its national energy group ( neg ) to bethesda , md , from houston , had the greatest impact on its trading activity . but the company also sold its energy services business and its texas gas transmission assets among other changes . " it really slowed down our trading [ and ] a large number of people stayed behind in houston , " said company spokesman patrick hurston . at the time of the move , the company estimated about half , or 100 , would make the move . hurston wouldn \' t say how many actually made the trip , but the company is still actively hiring . transcanada , which also underwent a massive reorganization last year , was the other company in the minus column with a 3 % decline in sales volume . the remainder of the group experienced large increases in volumes : enron at 94 % , duke with 15 % growth , sempra with 51 % and bp amoco with 100 % growth .', 'subject': 'article on gas marketers : top gas gorillas'}

" we now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energy costs , " senator feinstein said . " ferc has found the wholesale prices being charged in california to be unjust and unreasonable . this legislation essentially will mandate that once ferc makes such a finding , the agency will carry out its regulatory role . this is a $ 175 million a year agency . it is there to regulate the energy marketplace , and it should . what the federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis . unfortunately ferc has refused to do so . " " california \' s broken electricity market is a result of a flawed 1996 california law that deregulated wholesale costs , but left in place caps on retail prices . this was coupled with a requirement that the utilities divest themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity on the spot market , where prices have escalated dramatically . in hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario , so that today , california buys electricity at astronomical prices . we believe that ferc needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace .

{'body': 'as was foretold by some of the kern expansion shippers , these shippers are justifiably angry about the way kern has sold capacity in their open season , particularly as concerns shippers \' access to markets on socal gas through wheeler ridge . however , what \' s even more encouraging here is to see that shippers are now validating the message tw embodied in its gir proposal - - new market entrants should only have secondary rights to socal system capacity in instances where there is a capacity shortage . shippers dispute kern \' s wheeler ridge sales chevron , amoco production , canwest gas supply , aera energy and rme petroleum have called on ferc to stop kern river gas transmission from overselling delivery point rights at wheeler ridge into the southern california gas co . distribution system . the firm shippers said in comments filed this week that , in a situation strangely similar to the recent el paso capacity reallocation case , kern river has oversold capacity at wheeler ridge , and its proposed expansion project will only exacerbate the situation ( docket cpol - 31 ) . on nov . 15 , 2000 , kern filed an application to expand its system and provide 74 , 500 dth / d of additional delivery point capacity at wheeler ridge into socal gas . but firm shippers claim recent data provided by kern and socal gas indicates kern river already has sold more than the 450 mmcf / d of firm delivery point capacity it has available into wheeler ridge . firm shippers told ferc . kern river has sold 468 . 4 mmcf / d of capacity at wheeler ridge . not true , says lynn dahlberg , kern \' s manager of marketing . " we have to date subscribed at 450 , 000 dth / d . and unless we subscribe at more than 830 , 000 dth / d , we have not sold more capacity than socal has takeaway . " the combined kern - mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600 , 000 dth / d , with kern having 450 , 00 and mojave 150 , 000 . " we can move more than that capacity , and we have , " she added . socal gas has noted that it curtails nominations from kern on a regular basis , shippers said . with the proposed expansion project , kern will be " creating the same type of firm delivery point over - sale situation that the commission found to be unjust and unreasonable on el paso natural gas at el paso \' s socal gas / topock delivery point , " they added . while they support the expansion , they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in southern california degraded . they also complained that kern \' s marketing affiliate is one of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to wheeler ridge . dahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the wheeler ridge point , but " adding more players to wheeler gives markets on socal more supply options . shippers have to compete . " the shippers are concerned , however that " substantial benefits under the currently structured proposal accrue primarily to kern river and its affiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers . . . . " the commission should prohibit kern from selling additional firm rights at wheeler ridge , or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity [ emphasis added ] that is of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers , they said .', 'subject': 'kern river problems'}

' ' they are the market maker with this pipeline , ' ' said loretta lynch , the president of the california public utilities commission , which has struggled to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages . el paso ' ' sets the price in california , ' ' ms . lynch said , and what it did was intentional . ' ' it has affected the price , ' ' she said , ' ' for everything related to heat and electrical power prices in the state . ' ' california ' s complaint to the federal agency contends that el paso merchant ' ' has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity ' ' on the pipeline . the state also charges that el paso natural gas , the pipeline ' s owner , has had no incentive to spur competition , by offering discounts to other users , because the two companies are corporate siblings . the state said that el paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit anticompetitive behavior . the sealed filings in the el paso case indicated that the company expected to make money by widening the ' ' basis spread ' ' - - the difference between what gas can be bought for in producing basins of texas and new mexico , at one end of the pipeline , and its price on delivery to southern california . as it turned out , spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price of gas soared in california , adding to costs for wholesale electricity that pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy . california utilities paid $ 6 . 2 billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 months , state officials estimated . the utilities are not allowed to recoup the costs from customers . while the cost of 1 , 000 cubic feet of gas typically is less than $ 1 higher at the california end of the pipeline , spot prices in the state rose to almost $ 50 more than the texas - new mexico price in december . to executives of the parent company , the el paso corporation , the accusations of market manipulation are ludicrous . high gas prices in california , el paso executives said in interviews , are easily explained by soaring demand , the poor credit standing of the state ' s utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or store enough gas for winter . ' ' the idea that anybody is holding back on california is really ridiculous , ' ' said clark c . smith , president of el paso merchant ' s operations in north america . some el paso customers , though , agreed with california officials . the pacific gas this year , it is expected to have $ 700 million in north america alone . in its latest quarterly report , el paso attributed those profits , in part , to ' ' commodity market and trading margins ' ' that were enhanced by ' ' power price volatility , particularly in the western united states . ' ' critics contend that el paso set out to exploit those conditions . according to the sealed filings , on feb . 14 , 2000 , the day before el paso merchant was awarded the pipeline capacity , executives made a presentation to william a . wise , chief executive of the parent company , laying out the rationale for the bid . the presentation outlined what it termed ' ' strategic advantages , ' ' including ' ' more control of total physical markets ' ' and the ' ' ability to influence the physical market to the benefit of any financial / hedge position , ' ' according to the sealed filings . the passages suggested that el paso expected the deal to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its risk . for every one - cent increase in the spread on gas prices , the presentation said , el paso merchant stood to make an additional $ 2 . 4 million . under the heading ' ' challenges , ' ' according to the sealed filings , the presentation stated that storage was needed ' ' to help manipulate physical spreads , adding to the overall transport / storage cost . ' ' on april 14 , according to the sealed filings , el paso merchant ' s president at the time , greg g . jenkins , wrote a memorandum to mr . wise involving an update for directors meeting later that month . the memorandum stated : ' ' we will make money two ways : 1 ) increase the load factor , 2 ) widen the basis spread . ' ' the language appears to suggest that el paso merchant would profit by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline - - the load factor - - while increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it could be sold for at the other end - - the basis spread . in an interview , mr . smith , the el paso merchant executive , said that the unit ' s prices , and profits , on bulk gas sales in california were locked in months in advance , so that the company could not benefit from rising prices in the spot market . otherwise , mr . smith declined to provide any details about money made on the pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in prices ahead of time . in addition , mr . smith said that nearly all of el paso merchant ' s pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last year , with no capacity withheld to increase prices . the company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in the sealed documents . but el paso merchant , in a filing with federal regulators , said california ' s complaint had ' ' misconstrued and incorrectly interpreted ' ' what it termed ' ' snippets of data . ' ' about this report this article and others on california ' s energy problems are part of a joint effort with the pbs series ' ' frontline ' ' that will result in a documentary later this year . photo : the el paso natural gas pipeline passes near topock , ariz . a dispute over bidding for its use has spurred a debate about oversight of the industry .

( let \' s say the 1 year bid won ) . at the end of the year , is the rofr calculated on the $ 3 . 00 value the shipper holds the transport at or is it based on current market conditions . let \' s say the market value has collapsed and the market views this capacity as worth only $ . 28 / dth and the current shipper is willing to match that rate does that mean he can retain the capacity ? then for what term , whatever the market bids that piece for or will there be a set time the ( in years ) that the holder of the capacity will have to match regardless of what the bidder bids ? i hope this example makes sense . if not , please give me a call to discuss at ( 303 ) 252 - 6224 . thanks for your help . terri dickerson > > > " lokay , michelle " 04 / 17 / 01 12 : 09 pm > > > transwestern pipeline company red rock expansion from october 30 , 2000 to november 17 , 2000 , transwestern posted a notice of open season . as a result of the response to the open season , transwestern has filed for ferc authority to expand its mainline by 150 , 000 mmbtu by a proposed in service date of june 2002 . the project is known as the red rock expansion . transwestern is continuing to solicit bids from open season respondents as well as all other interested parties . interested parties should submit bids conforming to the criteria listed below . the deadline for bidding is friday , april 20 , 2001 at 5 : 00 p . m . cdt . if you have questions or need further information , please contact lorraine lindberg at ( 713 ) 853 - 5403 or your marketing representative . volume : 150 , 000 dth / day points of delivery / receipt : primary receipt points : east of thoreau primary delivery points : topock lateral capacity : 92 , 000 mmbtu - available point capacity : pge / topock , poi # 56698 ( 126 , 000 mmbtu ) mojave topock , poi # 56696 , ( 280 , 000 mmbtu ) calpine / southpoint , poi # 78113 ( 76 , 000 mmbtu ) other delivery points : southwest gas , poi # 78003 ( 86 , 000 mmbtu ) citizens / griffith , poi # 78069 ( 120 , 000 mmbtu ) subject to availability of additional delivery point capacity : socal needles , poi # 10487 ( 50 , 000 mmbtu ) awarding capacity 1 . written offers must include material terms ( rate , term , points , quantity ) . shipper should indicate whether it will accept partial volume in the event allocation is necessary . 2 . shippers \' binding bids must be accompanied by a valid request for gas transportation service form . 3 . shippers submitting bids containing terms or conditions unacceptable to transwestern shall not be accepted . 4 . if the total volume of all bids received by transwestern exceeds the capacity of the proposed expansion , transwestern will award the capacity based on the highest net present value bid ( calculated consistent with the net present value provisions of transwestern \' s tariff ) . 5 . in the event of a tie , the capacity shall be awarded on a pro rata basis . 6 . transwestern reserves the right to reject any bid less than the maximum tariff rate , or any bid that would cause the red rock expansion to be uneconomic .', 'subject': 're : transwestern expansion'}

{'body': 'pursuant to our meeting , i was to check the posting timelines to see if we could make the 1 day category , include 5 months or less rather than less than 5 months . based on a recent decision ( march 16 , 2001 ) in columbia gas transmission co , i think we can . in columbia , the commission approved columbia \' s proposal to establish an interactive auction process in which firm capacity available for less than one year would be posted for an initial one hour period from 7 : 00 am to 8 : 00 a . m . capacity offered for one year or more would be subject to an initial posting period of 5 days . this indicates movement by the commission to much shorter posting periods for capacity available for less than one year . i think we can modify our procedures to include up to 5 months in the 1 day posting category . however , we may want to consider combining the 3 day category and 1 day category into one 1 day category for capacity offered for less than one year . in addition , for capacity offered for one year or more , columbia will advertise a proposed offer on its ebb one day prior to the five - day posting of the capacity . ( this supports a special posting in advance . ) although it is good to have these internal procedures , what is important to the commission is that pipeline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of capacity . the columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bid for max rates . columbia proposed that it not be required to sell capacity to shippers bidding the maximum rate for a term of less than 12 months until one day prior to the commencement of gas flow detailed in the auction package . the commission rejected this in favor of the industrials \' proposal : beginning 30 days before the capacity is available for service , columbia must accept bids at the max rate for a term of five months to less than 12 months . beginning seven days before the capacity is available , columbia must accept maximum rate bids for terms of more than one month to less tha 5 months . columbia must accept maximum rate bids for a term of one month or less one day before gas flows . thanks , maria - - - - - original message - - - - - from : hass , glen sent : wednesday , may 30 , 2001 4 : 32 pm to : harris , steven ; miller , mary kay ; fossum , drew ; dornan , dari ; pavlou , maria ; pryor , tony ; donoho , lindy ; watson , kimberly ; darveaux , mary ; fawcett , jeffery ; lokay , michelle ; lindberg , lorraine ; lohman , tk ; kirk , steve ; paladino , ranelle subject : capacity posting procedures attached for your review is a redlined draft of tw \' s capacity posting procedure including changes suggested at our meeting yesterday . one remaining item is to decide whether capacity available for " less than 5 months " or " 5 months or less " will be designated as 1 day postings . please review and advise if you have any additional comments . thanks . gh >', 'subject': 're : capacity posting procedures'}

line gc data is used as pipeline quality of gas in panhandle lateral because gs report from owens corning delivery point is quite similar to agave gc , 2 ) gas temperatures will become nearly the same as ground temperatures which is provided on scada at p - 1 and p 2 3 ) pressure and temperature profiles on the panhandle lateral at 6 / 14 , 9 : 00 am flowing conditions are listed below the following graph ( attached in ms word ) is a phase envelope using the agave red bluff gas analysis . by mapping the above relative pressure / temperature points it is clearly observed that pipeline pressure and temperature conditions approach and cross the hydrocarbon dewpoint line indicating that liquids would exist . the graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced . that explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between cs p - 2 and cs p - 3 . furthermore , using the process model used to generate the phase envelope , the model indicates that gas at 800 psig and 65 degf would exist in both vapor and liquid phases . using a flow rate of 100 mmcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately 80 bbls . per day that could amount to approximately 2400 bbls . per month . this liquid volume compares closely to some of the recovery volumes reported by randy and walt below . lets get together on a conference call to further discuss findings and possible solutions . for a first stab , how about tuesday , 6 / 19 , at 8 : 00 am ( cst ) ? reply with availability and number of ports required . ef 713 / 853 -

corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel . when the line has large amounts of condensate , we have been asking energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point . this is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure . the gas from energas is not measured . they used to have the contract , but when we got it , they removed their meter setting . apparently they agreed ( verbally ) to supply gas to the plant in march , for a few hours , when a pig was run . the plant uses about 3 mmcf / d and energas was on for about 3 hours . i was notified today that energas sent us a bill for the march pig run when we used their gas for fuel . . . . . $ 21 , 000 ! obviously we will negotiate that amount , but they have us at a disadvantage . i can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours . everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule , we would not get large condensate amounts into p -

{'body': 'fyi - - below is the gas daily article about the acc comments filed at ferc in the ca . infrastructure proceeding . gh arizona warns of southwest capacity shortfall california is not the only state worried about the adequacy of its gas pipeline infrastructure . in recent correspondence with ferc , the arizona corporation commission urged federal regulators to put california \' s capacity shortage in a broader regional context ; failure to do so , the acc warned , might cause california \' s gas supply problems to spread to other states . " given the regional , multi - state nature of the interstate pipelines in the southwest , any actions taken by the ferc to address california \' s interstate pipeline system will have wide - spread ramifications for arizona and a number of other states , " said the acc . as part of its effort to tackle california \' s energy woes , ferc staff has been studying the state \' s pipeline infrastructure to see if there are ways to improve the delivery of gas . in may , the commission hosted a conference devoted entirely to gas transportation issues in california ( gd 5 / 25 ) ; representatives from neighboring states also got involved . in comments sent to ferc on june 22 , the acc expressed concern that measures to remedy california \' s gas shortage might shift much - needed capacity away from its state . if federal regulators do not press for the improvement of pipeline services throughout the south - west , it might " lead to a worsening of regional problems and / or a shifting or spreading of problems from california to arizona and other states , " the acc argued . in particular , the acc said that it was alarmed about the continued reliance of arizona shippers on the el paso natural gas system . at present , two interstate pipelines - el paso and transwestern pipeline - serve the state , but the bulk of arizona shippers only have access to the el paso system . " the acc is becoming increasingly concerned with the pipeline capacity situation in arizona and whether current natural gas shippers in arizona , with existing contract rights on the el paso system , will receive reliable pipeline service in the future , " wrote the commission . " it is widely recognized that the el paso system running through arizona to california has been operating at very high utilization rates recently . additionally , it appears that little or no additional pipeline capacity will be added by el paso in the near future to serve existing cus - tomers and their existing contract rights , beyond the line 2000 expansion which will largely replace capacity that has been lost for other reasons . " el paso recently won approval for line 2000 , which will boost deliverability into califor - nia by as much as 230 million cfd . but despite efforts to add capacity , the pipeline has been dogged by complaints about access to its system . according to shippers in texas , arizona and new mexico , el paso has proposed a new allocation scheme that would force captive shippers to pay more for access to its system . echoing the comments of the acc , the shippers said they faced degradation of firm service rights because of el paso \' s diminished ability to deliver gas consistent with contractual obligations ( gd 5 / 30 ) . ferc , in fact , is planning a technical conference next month to discuss the issues raised by el paso \' s latest allocation plan . the meeting is scheduled for july 18 , but ferc allowed that the meeting may continue through july 19 . the concerns of the acc may help shore up the assertions of east - of - california shippers . contrasting the access that california shippers have to pipelines and storage facilities , the acc said , " ferc should ensure that captive shippers are not disadvantaged due to their lack of options . " most importantly , said the acc , ferc should encourage capacity additions that serve the needs of both existing shippers and expansion shippers . " the complexity of the issues and the potential for inadvertently exacerbating the region \' s pipeline capacity problems argues for a careful and thorough approach to the issues , ensuring that customers in arizona , california and elsewhere in the region are well served by any change in the treatment of pipeline capacity in the southwest , " the acc concluded .

{'body': "interesting article , especially since it came from britain . . . it does mention enron too . the next global city ? the blob that ate east texas jun 21 st 2001 houston from the economist print edition ( june 23 , 2001 ) for most outsiders , texas is a foreign country . its biggest city , though , might surprise the rest of the world when a texan in a big hat tells you how wonderful his home town is , reach for the salt . bob lanier , the former mayor of houston , isn ' t actually wearing a stetson as he gazes from his penthouse down on a city that sprawls 25 miles away in every direction . but metaphorically he is . houston , he claims , could become one of the great cities of the world . the remarkable thing is that he might be right . from the time the city was founded in 1836 until the 1970 s , houston doubled in size almost every decade . then , despite one of the deepest slumps any city had experienced since the 1930 s , the metropolitan area managed to add lm people in the 1990 s to grow to 4 . 7 m , making houston the fourth - largest city in america . it is already bigger than berlin and , with a gdp of around $ 215 billion a year , has a larger economy than hong kong . because it is the nearest metropolis to the cities of northern mexico , it may attract another 2 m people over the next two decades , which would give it almost the same size of population as london has now . but a global city ? these are few and far between . houston can hardly dream of becoming a global financial centre like london , new york or tokyo . but its business leaders think it could become a cosmopolitan , entrepreneurial hub , a hong kong , a san francisco or even a new los angeles . it shares la ' s smog , its sprawl , its latino culture , even its ugly hubris ; and by some measures it surpasses la ' s ability to reinvent its economy . can it use its adaptability to turn itself into a properly international place ? oil be there for you its hopes still depend disproportionately on its most global industry . energy accounts for half of houston ' s economy . during the 1970 s , while the rest of america stagflated , houston boomed as high oil prices sucked billions into the country ' s oil capital . in that decade alone , the city built almost as much new office space as the total amount of commercial property available in san francisco . money was being lent and business plans formed on the assumption that oil would go to $ 50 a barrel . at the height of the boom , about 80 % of the city ' s economy was oil - related . the bust was traumatic . by the mid - 1980 s , all that new office space stood empty . every big local bank was taken over . only one of the property developers then in business is left . unsurprisingly , a certain paranoia lingers in the city about the oil business . the greater houston partnership , the main business lobby , has spent the past 20 years frantically encouraging the city to diversify . yet the fact is that the energy business and houston itself have emerged stronger from the terrible bust . as company after company was forced to cut back , they collapsed their operations back into houston and seem unlikely to be dispersed again . in 1999 , when oil slumped to $ 10 a barrel and the number of oil rigs in america fell to its lowest point in living memory , houston still managed to add energy jobs . now another boom is in prospect , with oil prices high again . matt simmonds , the head of a local energy consultancy , argues that america ' s past reluctance to build new power plants will force it to increase energy capacity by around 30 % in the next ten or 15 years . the rig count is already 50 % above last year , and natural gas exploration is soaring . if oil prices stay high ( a big if ) and if other countries share america ' s energy worries , houston will grow in importance . it is hampered by a wild - catting reputation . in fact , the energy business is changing in three significant ways , and houston is the centre of all of them . first , technology . not long ago , oil drills went down to 1 , 500 feet ( 457 metres ) . now they go to 15 , 000 feet . companies use four - dimensional computer imaging to plan new fields ( time is the fourth ) . this is making oil an information - intensive business and puts a premium on the kinds of skills available in houston . second , the cost of new oilfield exploration and development has risen so far that even newly merged behemoths cannot always finance them alone . this makes deal - making vital , which is good for the city where deals are made . if you are not attending , say , lunch at houston ' s petroleum club , you are out of the loop . third and most important , oil is now only part of a bigger energy business , which includes electricity . once divided into self - contained regional markets run by local utilities , the electricity business is being changed by the gradual emergence of a national grid dominated by power producers and traders . big users now decide whether to buy power at long - or short - term rates , rather as they arrange their financing . a new business of energy arbitraging is emerging , and itscentre is houston . three of the five new skyscrapers going up downtown have as their main tenants energy companies that did not exist ten years ago . one of them , enron , is building a 50 , 000 - square - foot trading floor ? ? single - company answer to the chicago board of trade . enron has probably been houston ' s most successful energy company of the past ten years . it has never explored for , pumped up , or refined a single drop ofoil . out of the black stuff however well - placed houston is to take advantage of the energy business , it will never be a great city as a one - trick pony . its boosters point to other strengths : * trade . houston is america ' ssecond largest port , which is remarkable considering it is 50 miles from the sea . * computers . the city is home to compaq , america ' s third - largest pc maker . if you include dell , based in austin , two of america ? ? four big computer firms are in south - east texas , not silicon valley . * space . the national aeronautics and space administration centre is in houston , thanks to lyndonjohnson , a native son . * medicine . houston is home to probably the largest medical complex in the world . in a moment of extraordinary optimism , the city set aside 700 acres in the middle of town for medicine . the hospitals , clinics and research centres of the texas medical centre employ 55 , 000 people and deal with 70 , 000 patients a day . st luke ' s has performed more heart surgery than any other hospital in the world . md anderson and the texas children ' s hospital are among the top two in their respective specialities , cancerand paediatrics . this list has holes in it . houston has no real financial services ( the mainstay of the biggest global cities ) or pharmaceuticals ( despite the medical centre ) . and some of its new industries are less robust than the boosters claim . its port ' s success depends on the vagaries of mexico ' s economy . space does not employ many people and is unlikely to grow until the far - off day when the commercialisation of space arrives . the texas medical centre is set up on a not - for - profit basis , so it has not been able to commercialise its activities ( hence the lack of drug firms ) , though a new biotechnology park may help . in fact , houston ' s main hope for diversifying lies not so much in particular sectors as in something intangible : its stunning ability to create new firms . for the past three years , houston has created more new companies than any city in america . it is almost certainly the best place either to start a business or find a first - time job . the reasons for this are the real driving forces behind its success . the beauty of entrepreneurialism the first is unmeasurable , a no - holds - barred optimism of the old school . one survey shows that about two - thirds of americans agree with the assertion that if you work hard in this city , eventually you will succeed . but houston ' s figure even at the bottom of the city ' s recession was 75 % , and now it is 88 % , the highest - ever , and ( says the survey ' s author , stephen klineberg of rice university ) the highest of any bigamerican city . it may not be true that anything is possible in houston , but people act as if it were . bill gilmer , the chief economist of the houston branch of the federal reserve system , argues that this explains why houston recovered so fast from the oil bust : unemployed engineers went out and set up their own firms , just as aerospace engineers did in los angeles when the end of the cold war put them out of business . the second advantage is technical . uniquely for an american metropolis , houston has no citywide zoning ordinances . when planning decisions are made , they are made by developers on their own land . for the would - be entrepreneur , it is thus easier and cheaper to find a place to set up shop in houston than in any other city in america . lack of zoning laws hands power to developers who insist that new developments be large to capture economies of scale . they expand in leapfrog fashion , ignoring small 20 - acre plots near the city centre in favour of vast planned towns further out . this drives land prices sharply down , especially the further you go from the centre . on top of that , an aversion to red tape makes it easy to get building permits . barton smith , a land economist at the university of houston , reckons lack of red tape is at least as important to keep costs low as lack of zoning laws . lack of zoning also makes neighbourhoods slightly more mixed in terms of usage ( residential and commercial are more muddled up than elsewhere ) and racially . because there are no zoning laws to force , say , a bankrupt restaurant to re - open as a restaurant , areas change shape quickly . at the same time , houston is less segregated racially than any other city , bymost measures . one should not be over - impressed by this . whites in houston may be more likely than their peers elsewhere to have had a conversation with someone of a different race in the previous week , but that hasn ' t stopped them heading for the suburbs . much of the racial mixture downtown is of blacks , latinos and asians ( the city has america ' s second - largest vietnamese settlement after southern california ) . but because zoning laws do not enable local groups to keep poor people out ( for example , by requiring that all housing plots be huge ) , houston remains racially desegregated by american standards . this helps draw in immigrant workers , creating a pool of labour . that leads to the third of houston ' s main characteristics which should prove an advantage in the 21 st century : racial tolerance . houston looked like a southern town until the 1970 s : white , with a large black minority . a generation later , its population is roughly one - third white , one - third black and ( slightly over ) one - third brown . other cities have similar profiles but none went from a bi - racial to amulti - racial city quite so abruptly . even more strikingly , it did so peacefully . houston has not had a race riot since 1914 . for the largest southern city to have gone through the civil - rights era and its aftermath without upheaval is a remarkable comment on its politics . minorities have long been fully or over - represented in the city council , county commissions and the texas state legislature . bob stein of rice university argues that , unlike other growing cities , houston is reinventing the tradition of a powerful group of civic - minded business leaders , the fate of whose companies is closely tied to that of the city . ken lay , enron ' s chairman , is an example . he has been the driving force behind the building of two sports stadiums , and has a pet project to boost child literacy . rumour has it that he may run for mayor . the effect of this sort of civic - minded activism showed up in the late 1990 s . at a time when america was busily abolishing affirmative - action programmes , houston went the other way : it had a new one approved in a city - wide referendum . for better or worse , this showed how racially tolerant it is . for how much longer ? in many ways , houston is thriving because it has kept alive an old - fashioned , industrial mode of growth , built on cheap land , low taxes , immigrant labour and unfettered pro - business policies . this model may not be enough in the next decades . houston is ugly . it was hardly charming to begin with and has pulled down many of its old buildings . it may have to pull down even more after recent floods caused $ 2 billion - worth of damage . it is also , as al gore rudely pointed out during the presidential campaign , polluted . since cities now have to attract skilled workers with quality of life benefits , this is a big problem , and not one that can be overcome by cheap housing . business leaders are frantically trying to catch up . in an unusual example of bipartisanship , a fervently conservative property developer has joined forces with a former member of the clinton administration to back a $ 500 m bond issue to plant lm trees . the greater houston partnership has executed an about - turn on pollution . having argued last year that new pollution controls damage growth , it is now on a crash course to cut ozone - creating emissions as fast as it can . if this sudden change of mind is real , it poses a tough question about zoning . houston has 2 , 300 people an acre , compared with 6 , 000 in los angeles and 20 , 000 in new york ( at the other end of the scale ) . this extraordinary extensiveness is expensive . at one point in the early 1990 s , houston alone was spending more on roads than any state except california ( and , of course , texas ) . there are doubts about how much further sprawl can go . three - quarters of the best - paid jobs are still on or within the inner ring road . some new suburbs are 50 miles away . can the city continue to burst outwards while attracting the skilled people whose jobs are downtown ? and surely that means introducing zoning ? lastly , houston faces a severe problem in the one area where its national reputation is high : education . to run his number - one priority , mr bush picked as secretary of education rod paige , a former head of the houston independent school district . the president claimed , correctly , that mr paige had overseen substantial improvements in the city ' s education , especially among minorities . what he did not say is that these improvements have been nothing like enough . despite successes in individual schools , half of all latinos fail to graduate from high school , compared with 10 % of whites and 20 % of blacks . whites are abandoning houston ' s public schools . they represent only 12 % of pupils ; 54 % are latino . more than a quarter of today ' s schoolchildren are likely to dropout . in a world where a good job depends on having a college degree , this is alarming . rice university ' s mr klineberg argues that new immigrants from mexico arrive lagging further behind the rest of the country educationally than did the wave of immigrants in the early 1900 s . the first wave took several generations to catch up . today ' s immigrants will have to close a bigger gap more quickly . if they do not , they may end up in an underclass that could scratch at houston ' sracial harmony . this is houston can houston make it ? the city has experienced the three big transformations that affect america in their purest form : the change from a raw - material economy to services ; the change from a bi - racial to a multi - racial place ; and the moderation of a no - holds - barred pro - business culture to take account of environmental and social costs . elsewhere , these changes have occurred over 50 years . houston has lived through them in 20 . and the next 20 years will probably be just as dramatic and successful . hold onto those stetsons . copyright ? ? 1995 -

competition is not to blame for california ' s problems ; and basic economic principles of supply , demand , and prices affect market outcomes . section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in california and the problems that occurred beginning in may 2000 . section 3 , the heart of this paper , offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry . this section makes several points : * maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads . * ensure that enough infrastructure ( transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity ) is in place and planned to meet growing loads , maintain reliability , connect new generators to the grid , support large regional markets , and provide fuel to power plants . * encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic - pricing and voluntary - load - reduction programs ( i . e . , couple retail and wholesale markets ) . * create honest retail competition : avoid standard - offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors . * encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks . * create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy , ancillary services , and transmission congestion . * monitor and minimize horizontal market power ( generation ) and vertical market power ( combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission ) . ultimately , competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices , better align consumer prices with producer costs , improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation , maintain or improve reliability , and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options . but , this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated . it is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern , high - tech society ; electricity is our most flexible fuel , providing light , heat , motive power , and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment . also , electricity truly is a real - time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time . although the problems that have occurred in california are substantial and worrisome , regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long - term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short - term problems that may occur . they also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state . finally , competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated ;

( 90 , 000 dt / day ) . the expansion \' s proposed initial daily incremental rate on a 100 % - load - factor basis , excluding fuel , is 70 ? / dt for 10 - year firm service and 56 . 8 ? / dt for 15 - year firm service . in addition , the 2003 expansion shippers would be responsible for paying a fuel in - kind reimbursement factor of 3 . 05 % for volumes transported from wyoming to california ; the rates would be lower for shorter trips . as for supply , given the large volume of remaining reserves and the amount of drilling activity in the rocky mountain region , production could increase by more than 1 . 5 bcf / day over the next year and by 4 . 5 bcf / day over the next five years , according to a report prepared for kern river by barlow and haun inc . in addition to the gas available from processing plants directly connected to kern river in southwest - ern wyoming , shippers have access to supplies from other regions via northwest pipeline corp . , colorado interstate gas co . and questar pipeline co . at the opal / muddy creek market center , the application said . two additional interstate pipelines - wyoming interstate co . ltd . and overthrust pipeline co . - an - nounced related open seasons in june that could result in interconnects providing access to supplies from the wind river and wamsutter basins , the pipeline noted . to meet the project \' s may 1 , 2003 , in - service date , kern river asked the commission to issue a prelimi - nary determination on nonenvironmental matters by feb . 1 , 2002 , and a full certificate by may 1 , 2002 .', 'subject': 'kern river 2003 expansion'}

" we can \' t work with ( the rate ) as it is , " said chad jones , a questar spokesperson . " it definitely doesn \' t go far enough to remove the obstacles in the way of developing new pipelines in southern california . it still doesn \' t level the playing field . although it is better than the current rls ( residual load service ) tariff ; it still punishes customers who want to take partial service from a socalgas competitor . " customers still have to pay higher interruptible penalties than in other parts of the state , and higher rates for balancing services . we \' re at the point where we \' re not going to stop trying to market capacity on southern trails , but we \' re definitely at the point where we have to consider some alternative uses for the california portion ( of the 700 - miles , 16 - inch - diameter pipeline ) . " one of the alternatives would be to operate the california part of the line as a petroleum or liquids line carrying product from the long beach harbor area to existing petroleum or liquid products pipelines in and around the california - arizona border . that \' s the alternative , however , jones said , but finding a customer for a major portion of the converted pipeline \' s 120 mmcf / d capacity is still questar \' s preference . after months of reviewing the issue and weighing alternatives , the california public utilities commission last week established a new " peaking " or standby charge for customers taking partial service from a socalgas competitor , allowing those customers to pay only for the amounts of gas they use at any given time from the local gas transmission and distribution utility , socalgas . the cpuc tried to balance the need for the local gas utility to be made whole so added fixed costs did not have to be shifted to other customers , while trying to " encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry - picking or overbuilding , " according to cpuc president loretta lynch . questar officials said tuesday they have pretty much exhausted their appeal resources , and they are " not about to go head - to - head with the established big boys " in lobbying california \' s governor or state legislature , jones said . " thus , we \' re still looking for a large customer who would be willing to break the gridlock in southern california in the name of promoting competition . " the east - of - california portion of the southern trails pipeline is already fully subscribed and will start operations mid - year next year , jones said .', 'subject': 'fw : southern trails article on western leg'}

{'body': 'lorna cec blames overtaxed in - state gas system for high prices confirming what the state \' s energy crisis made abundantly clear months ago , the california energy commission ( cec ) staff last week released its final draft report on the state \' s natural gas infrastructure , concluding that it is constrained and has caused higher - than - average wholesale gas prices , particularly in the southern half of the state . but the report did not totally rule out market manipulation as a culprit . it concludes that a combination of infrastructure shortcomings and possible market manipulation has to the higher natural gas prices in california . " market participants may have manipulated prices even higher than justified by existing infrastructure bottlenecks , but it is the inability of gas customers to rely on competition between gas suppliers that contributed to higher prices in california , " the report stated . among a half dozen recommended steps the state can take to help bolster initiatives already under way by utilities and merchant energy suppliers , said the cec report , which will go to the five - member commission for approval aug . 22 . it stressed encouraging the development of more " independent " gas storage facilities , and taking steps to more fully " optimize " storage , including an increase in its use by large end - users . as a backdrop to the study \' s conclusions , the cec report noted that both upgrades of in - state infrastructure and interstate pipeline capacity are needed to meet " growing demand in california and throughout the west . " if the current proposed interstate pipeline expansions don \' t come online as scheduled , the cec report said other state actions would be necessary , although it did not spell out what those might be . for the future , the report said that the cec will track more closely storage levels and natural gas prices because they are " key indicators " of how extensive problems might be at any given time in the state \' s natural gas infrastructure . the other steps recommended for action are : 1 ) encouraging more in - state natural gas production ( the state legislature already has proposed a new law to provide incentives ) ; 2 ) setting new " design criteria and reliability standards " for the state \' s gas system to reflect what the cec calls " the changing nature of natural gas demand , especially for electric generators ; " 3 ) establishing integrated planning of the state \' s pipeline and storage facilities ; and 4 ) developing a " natural gas curtailment scheme " emphasizing efficiency and optimizing gas use in times of shortages . the 111 - page report , " natural gas infrastructure issues , " prepared by the cec electricity and natural gas committee for final adoption of the five - member politically appointed commission , assessed the state gas industry from the perspective of supply , pipeline capacity ( both inter - and intrastate ) and storage , with the added elements of the recent historically severe drought in the pacific northwest and the in - state pipeline constraints at the california - arizona border . as part of the proposed implementation , the report recommends that the cec work more closely with the california public utilities commission to develop a new curtailment policy that is " fair and at the same time promotes the efficient use of natural gas " during shortage periods . it also proposes that the cec this fall conduct a workshop to determine ways to have non - core , large energy - intensive customers better optimize their use of natural gas storage .', 'subject': "i didn ' t realize the report that i sent out yesterday about the california energy commission ' s conclusions on the state ' s natural gas infrastructure was so long ! here is a brief synopsis . i hope this helps everyone . i haven ' t had time to read the full report yet , but if i see a better summary come out , i ' ll send it to you as well ."}

( 4 to 5 days ) we then requested that the roswell cdc ( ernie delossantos ) determine the availability of approximately 150 " of x 42 356 wall 10 " pipe , 12 ea . y 42 365 wall 90 \' s , and 1 ea . y 42 365 wall 45 . ( all material is available at redman supply in farmington ) conclusion : mr . dickenson called with the results this morning and informed us that we appear to be exceeding allowable stress levels . the stress levels calculated by dickinson were in excess of yield as follows : 1 . 09 % of smys at the connection between the recycle / surge line and the discharge header , and 1 . 01 % of smys at the elbow immediately outside the building wall on the 10 " recycle line . his recommendation was that the piping be cut and re - welded to return the piping to a lower stress condition and that suitable pipe supports , not subject to subsidence , be provided . conference calls with engineering ( spalding , eisenstein , rance , pebdani , minnoti ? ? ? ) were set up to review the data with mr . dickenson and it was decided to have greg mcilwain on location monday in conjunction with mike mccracken to initiate the necessary repairs . after much discussion with dickenson with regards to the modeling performed , engineering indicated that the system is operational and therefore we will remain loaded until early next week when repairs are made . the repairs will be isolated to the # 3 unit only so , the downtime is not expected to exceed 2 days ( 48 hours ) . however , furhter evaluation by mcilwain will confirm timelines . if anyone has questions through the weekend prior to mondays call , i can be reached at 520 - 853 - 3253 .', 'subject': 're : sj pipe settling'}

{'body': 'transwestern denies withheld capacity to boost negotiated deals a transwestern pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for california from its recourse - rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates . mary kay miller , vice president of rates and certificates , acknowledged transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes ( prior to posting its available capacity ) with two shippers - - sempra energy and richardson products ii ltd . - - that subsequently entered into negotiated - rate transactions . but she stressed that requests for capacity by sempra energy and richardson were considered " moot " by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted . " even if they would have sent . . . a fax the day before " capacity became available , " it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted " at that time , said miller . capacity requests that came in prior to jan . 31 , the day that available capacity was posted for february contracts on transwestern , were " null and void . " the only " relevant " ones were those that transwestern received on or after jan . 31 , she noted . miller spent much of wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for ferc and producers about transwestern \' s methods for notifying customers about available capacity , the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre - posting contacts with sempra energy and richardson . it was the first day of a ferc hearing exploring charges that transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated - rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $ 27 / mmbtu last february , far in excess of the pipeline \' s maximum allowed rate of 38 cents / mmbtu for firm transportation service to the california border . the commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated - rate contracts of sempra energy and richardson for a total 45 , 000 mmbtu / d of service on transwestern during february and march . richardson and sempra " clearly did not have any \' deal \' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted , " miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony . the two companies " had the right to the capacity only \' after \' they submitted their bids , \' after \' the posting period ended , \' after \' transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted , and \' after \' a contract was agreed upon between transwestern , richardson or sempra , " she noted . despite claims made by ferc energy industry analyst barry e . sullivan to the contrary , " transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates , " miller testified . sullivan , an analyst in the ferc office of markets , tariffs and rates \' ( omtr ) division of litigation , contends that transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates . in fact , he believes the pre - posting discussions between transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate , so that shippers might be more " willing to enter into negotiated - rate contracts above the recourse rate , in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [ it became ] available . " but miller counters that sullivan " offers not support for his claim . " she noted that even sempra energy and richardson , in response to a data request by southern california edison , support transwestern \' s claims . both companies replied " no " when asked whether " any employee of transwestern or any transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate . " the " capacity at issue was offered on transwestern \' s web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on transwestern \' s web site at the recourse rate ; there was no prohibition , restrictions , limitation , condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate ; and any potential shipper , including richardson or sempra , could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate . " sullivan contends that transwestern \' s motive for allegedly advancing negotiated - rate transactions at the expense of recourse - rate deals was pure profit . under questioning by thomas j . burgess of ferc \' s omtr , miller conceded that transwestern earned $ 1 . 8 million from sempra energy \' s contract in march , $ 1 . 3 million from richardson \' s march contract , and a " comparable " amount from richardson \' s february contract . she noted the pipeline received a " substantially higher " amount as a result of sempra \' s february contract , but she didn \' t provide an exact figure . ferc \' s sullivan estimated the pipeline \' s profit from the sempra february contract was more than $ 5 million . sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in transwestern \' s coffers would have gone to sempra energy and richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates . but miller countered that the commission \' s negotiated - rate policy " does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits . " furthermore , she said the transwestern case shouldn \' t be used to consider changes to the negotiated - rate policy , as sullivan has suggested . this case " is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated - rate policy should only be done on an industry - wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged .

" we thought the gas was greener , " said rob woronuk , a senior analyst with the canadian gas potential committee . still more potentially bad news came from the committee \' s report . in what woronuk said was an " embarrassment , " the committee has now decided that canadian coalbed methane may have less of a role to play than was previously thought . the committee reversed the findings of its 1997 report that estimated coalbed methane could account for up to 270 tcf of canada \' s overall 570 tcf natural gas resource . read the entire story at http : / / www . energyinsight . com', 'subject': 'canadian gas potential committee article'}

{'body': 'enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world . some of the changes took effect immediately ( e . g . additional security personnel ) and some are phasing in . while not all of the changes will be visible , there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities . in all the steps we take and recommendations we make , we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security , while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day - to - day business . primary responsibility for enron corp . security resides in our business controls organization . you can contact this organization through their website ( ) , by phone ( 713 - 345 - 2804 ) , or by email ( corporatesecurity @ enron . com ) . john brindle , senior director , business controls , leads this organization . please feel free to provide john and his team with your comments and questions , or to report security threats . we have two areas to update you on : changes in the access procedures for the enron center campus in houston and changes to our travel advisory . access to the enron center over the next few days , the following access control procedures will be instituted at the enron center ( and other facilities where practical ) : ? as employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the enron center , a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer . ? employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture id to obtain access to the enron center ( u . s . driver \' s license , u . s . or foreign passport , or some form of u . s . federal , state or local identification ) . ? visitors to the enron center must produce a valid photo id when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card . adult visitors without a valid photo id ( u . s . driver \' s license , u . s . or foreign passport , or some form of u . s . federal , state or local identification ) will not be allowed access to the enron center . ? visitors to enron facilities must be escorted by an enron employee or badged contractor at all times . ? visitors to the enron center will be met in the lobby by an enron employee or badged contractor , signed into a visitor \' s log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor , and escorted to their appointment . at the conclusion of the appointment , the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor , the visitor badge collected , and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor . ? employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines ; report suspicious activity to security ( phone 3 - 6300 ) , do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open , allowing " tail gating " by others . these will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at enron . we ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby . as we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment , we expect the inconvenience to decrease . we hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees . travel advisory update with the beginning of retaliatory strikes , we have two important recommendations : ? while the retaliatory strikes are ongoing , corporate security recommends that travel through or to the middle east be avoided . we continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to afghanistan , yemen , pakistan , indonesia , iran , iraq , sudan , somalia , tajikistan , turkmenistan , georgia , and the kyrgyz republic be canceled . in addition , we recommend that planned travel to egypt , israel , gaza / west bank , jordan , lebanon , saudi arabia , syria , and algeria be very carefully considered . ? for non - u . s . citizens traveling in the united states , corporate security recommends that you carry documentation . there have been several recent reports of non - u . s . citizens who reside in the united states being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding u . s . domestic flights . as a result , we suggest that all non - u . s . citizens who currently reside in the united states - and who do not have permanent resident alien status - carry their passport , form i - 94 and form i - 797 at all times . we would also suggest that permanent resident aliens carry their permanent resident ( green ) card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure . it appears that immigration officials may be applying a section of the immigration and nationality act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his / her " registration " documentation with them at all times . this can include a permanent resident card , form i - 94 card , employment authorization card , border crossing card , or a temporary resident card . immigration officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for " registration " documentation , but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere , it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status . we will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the corporate security website and by e - mail , as appropriate .', 'subject': 'security update'}

{'body': "today , we announced our third quarter earnings results , which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $ 0 . 43 . this marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year , which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines . in addition , we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $ 0 . 45 for the fourth quarter ( $ 1 . 80 for 2001 ) and $ 2 . 15 for 2002 . we made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about enron ' s business strategy and performance , so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter . over the past few months , we have met with analysts to discuss enron ' s performance . we received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units . in response to that feedback , we have provided results separately for several of our business units . for example , while we have provided volume figures for north america and europe , this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for enron americas and for europe and other commodities . in addition , information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for wholesale services . this quarter they are reported separately . finally , even though our broadband business is now part of enron wholesale services , we are continuing to report that business separately . following are the highlights of our businesses : wholesale services : total income before interest , minority interests and taxes ( ibit ) increased 28 % to $ 754 million in the third quarter . total wholesale physical volumes increased 65 % to 88 . 2 trillion british thermal units equivalent per day ( tbtue / d ) . americas : ibit increased 31 % to $ 701 million . natural gas volumes increased 6 % to 26 . 7 tbtu / d , and power volumes increased 77 % to 290 million megawatt hours ( mwh ) . europe and other commodity markets : ibit remained unchanged at $ 53 million as compared to last year . while physical gas and power volumes increased , low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat . retail services : enron energy services reported ibit of $ 71 million , compared to $ 27 million a year ago . so far this year , ees has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95 , 000 deals with small business customers . transportation and distribution : natural gas pipelines : ibit increased slightly to $ 85 million in the third quarter . portland general : we reported an ibit loss of $ ( 17 ) million this quarter compared to ibit of $ 74 million a year ago . this loss is due to power contracts pge entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter . last week , we announced an agreement to sell pge to northwest natural . this transaction is expected to close next year . global assets : this segment includes elektro , dabhol , tgs , azurix and enron wind . third quarter ibit remained unchanged at $ 19 million compared to last year . broadband services : ibit losses were $ ( 80 ) million in the current quarter compared to a $ ( 20 ) million loss last year . this quarter ' s results include significantly lower investment - related income and lower operating costs . corporate and other : this segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions . this segment reported an ibit loss of $ ( 59 ) million compared to $ ( 106 ) million a year ago . in addition , this quarter we announced one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion . over the past few quarters , we have conducted a thorough review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core businesses . these charges include : ? a $ 287 million write - down of azurix corp . ? $ 183 million associated with the restructuring of broadband services . this includes severance costs , a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers , and a write - down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers . ? $ 544 million related to losses from certain investments , primarily enron ' s interest in the new power company , broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement . with our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things : 1 ) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses , 2 ) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses , and 3 ) we expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors . to read the full earnings press release , go to www . enron . com / corp / pressroom / releases .", 'subject': 'third quarter earnings results'}

" indicated shippers claimed transwestern \' s inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available . while " both indicated shippers and ( ferc ) staff find it curious that set ( sempra energy trading ) and richardson ( products co . ) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them . . . curiosity does not translate into proof , " the judge said . witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting . the judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with transwestern \' s tariff . similarly , levanthal could find no evidence that transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity . the capacity was available at recourse rates , and the shippers knew those rates were available . " staff \' s arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures , but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power . " the two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the " index - to - index " formula that produced the higher rates , rather than take the recourse rate " to minimize any risk on transportation options . " the index - to - index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them . in this case the two points were the san juan basin and the socal needles delivery point . the case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations .', 'subject': 'ngi article on tw ruling'}

" he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment . " the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron \' s profits . questions for mr . lay were directed to mr . palmer , who said he had spoken with mr . lay and other company officials during the day . the initial disclosure about mr . lay \' s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago . last friday , mr . lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase , which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent , though he declined to elaborate . " things weren \' t desperate . . . we had alternatives , " mr . lay said . the 59 - year - old mr . lay won \' t have an executive position at the combined company , though he might be a director . for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million through the exercise of enron options , according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial . last year , mr . lay was paid $ 8 . 3 million in salary and bonus and more than $ 10 million in stock awards and other compensation . enron , the nation \' s largest energy trader , saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company \' s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers . those dealings are under investigation by the sec . last friday , enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston - based dynegy for stock , currently valued at about $ 10 . 7 billion . the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies . separately , the california public employees \' retirement system , which owns about three million enron and 500 , 000 dynegy shares , said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company . michael flaherman , chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron \' s board " failed in its responsibility " to monitor the activities of enron executives . mr . palmer , the enron spokesman , said mr . lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward . in february 2000 , when enron stock was trading between $ 60 and $ 70 a share and mr . lay was being widely lauded for his performance , he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously . last august , when chief executive jeffrey skilling quit unexpectedly , mr . lay assumed mr . skilling \' s duties and his contract term was extended by two years to dec . 31 , 2005 . under the terms of his contract , mr . lay is entitled to payment of $ 20 . 2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract , in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control . thus , mr . lay is entitled to three full years of payments , or $ 60 . 6 million . mr . lay , who took charge of the then - houston natural gas co . in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company , wasn \' t the only member of his family to benefit from enron \' s heady rise to a global energy giant . sec filings show that in recent years a sister of mr . lay , sharon lay , and a son , mark lay , received millions of dollars in salary , commissions and bonuses related to ms . lay \' s travel agency and a paper - products company connected to the younger mr . lay . mr . palmer said it is a " cheap shot " to criticize the lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements . " the contracts were bid out and fairly awarded , " mr . palmer said . ms . lay said her travel agency , of which she is president and half - owner , had won its enron business through competitive bidding and by providing " the very best service possible . " mark lay couldn \' t be reached for comment . coming on top of disclosures of enron \' s dealings with partnerships run by its own executives , the relationships between lay family members and the company again raise questions about enron \' s willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests . former chief financial officer andrew fastow and possibly other enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships . mark lay \' s dealings with enron date back to 1994 , according to the available sec filings . in may 1997 , mark lay and " certain other individuals " who together had been officers , directors or shareholders of a company called paper & print management corp . , or ppmc , entered into employment agreements with an enron unit , enron capital & trade resources , according to enron \' s 1998 proxy statement . the individuals helped set up " a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products , " according to the sec filing . mr . palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of enron \' s profitable paper and pulp - trading business . as part of the deal , enron agreed to reimburse ppmc $ 1 million for certain expenses . mark lay and his colleagues also agreed to " convey " to enron " certain intangible property rights " from ppmc . mark lay also got a three - year employment contract from enron as a vice president of enron capital & trade . he got a signing bonus of $ 100 , 000 , a minimum monthly salary of $ 12 , 500 , a minimum annual bonus of $ 100 , 000 for 1997 - 1999 and an option to purchase 20 , 000 enron shares . mark lay is no longer with enron and is now attending a seminary , said mr . palmer . since 1985 , sharon lay \' s firm , lay / wittenberg travel agency in the park inc . , has provided travel arrangements for employees of enron and its predecessor company . for this work the agency received $ 6 . 8 million from 1996 through 2000 . in an interview yesterday , ms . lay said enron accounted for more than half of her firm \' s revenue in some years . she said her brother \' s position was " more a problem " than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn \' t worked hard enough to get enron \' s business .', 'subject': 'fw :'}

- - gas and power businesses in north america and europe ; - - retail businesses in north america and europe ; and - - coal businesses in north america and europe . the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability . it \' s too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results . we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002 . i also remain optimistic that the actions we \' ve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns . according to our business unit leaders , we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships . non - core businesses our non - core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division . we have invested more than $ 8 billion in these businesses , and the return from them has been dismal . we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses . we already have more than $ 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year . they include ceg rio , a gas ldc in brazil ; ecoelectrica , a power plant and lng receiving terminal in puerto rico ; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in india . the approximately $ 2 . 9 billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals . businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets . while several of these businesses have very strong future prospects , we need to determine if their capital requirements and near - term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation . reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force . more information will follow as soon as it becomes available . credit rating / 10 - q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows : - - moody \' s at baa 3 " under review for further downgrade " - - fitch at bbb - " evolving status " - - s or investor relations , enron corp . , enron building , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3302 . in addition , the identity of the persons who , under sec rules , may be considered " participants in the solicitation " of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions , and any description of their direct or indirect interests , by security holdings or otherwise , are available in an sec filing under schedule 14 a made by each of dynegy and enron .', 'subject': 'overview of investor conference call'}

{'body': 'salvage a merger this article from nytimes . com has been sent to you by jimboman @ ix . netcom . com . i thought you might want to read this . - jim jimboman @ ix . netcom . com trying to restore confidence in enron to salvage a merger november 28 , 2001 by richard a . oppel jr . and andrew ross sorkin the enron corporation ( news / quote ) and dynegy inc . ( news / quote ) worked yesterday to find ways to bolster confidence in enron \' s weakened energy - trading business as the companies \' negotiators continued talks on revising the terms of their merger , executives close to the talks said . the renegotiated deal would cut the value of the acquisition by half , they said , to roughly $ 4 billion . dynegy , they said , was also prepared to invest at least an additional $ 250 million in enron , on top of the $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from dynegy \' s biggest investor , chevrontexaco , included in the initial deal announced nov . 9 . but dynegy wants the new cash backed by hard assets , and the companies were trying to identify and value enough enron holdings not already mortgaged to other creditors , the executives said . before a series of financial disclosures sent enron \' s stock into collapse and the company into the arms of dynegy , its houston rival , enron \' s natural gas and electricity trading floors did more business than the two largest competitors combined . they also accounted for the majority of enron \' s profits by far . but traders and wall street analysts said the business had steadily deteriorated amid questions about the depths of enron \' s financial straits . many traders have curtailed dealings with enron , and the executives close to the talks said dynegy officials scouring enron \' s books were having difficulty this week figuring out how much cash the trading operation was generating . the executives close to the talks said that the renegotiated terms for dynegy \' s acquisition of enron would lower the price to about 0 . 13 dynegy share for each share of enron , cutting by half the value of the deal announced nov . 9 , when dynegy offered 0 . 2685 share . if a deal is struck at 0 . 13 dynegy share , at yesterday \' s closing prices , dynegy would be paying about $ 5 . 32 an enron share , a 29 . 4 percent premium over enron \' s diminished stock price . the premium was 20 . 6 percent over enron \' s closing price on the day that the deal was announced . both companies are seeking promises from enron \' s bank lenders to extend debt repayment dates until after the merger closes . and they are also discussing adding provisions that could limit dynegy \' s ability to back out of the combination . the two companies are also working to arrange a cash infusion of $ 500 million from j . p . morgan chase ( news / quote ) and citigroup ( news / quote ) that would provide enron with desperately needed new cash . but there is growing concern that the cash infusion from the banks will not calm investors \' fears or reassure energy traders , leading dynegy to seek an additional $ 500 million in cash for enron . late yesterday , the two companies were hung up over whether enron , which has already used many of its most prized assets as collateral for loans , has enough assets left to serve as collateral for the additional money , according to executives close to the talks . a number of enron assets were being examined , including some that have already been used to obtain other loans , the executives said . the assets include : transwestern pipeline , a major natural gas pipeline that links the gas - producing basins of texas and the southwest with california ; enron \' s stake in other gas - pipeline assets ; its 9 . 8 percent stake , worth about $ 400 million , in eog resources ( news / quote ) , a former subsidiary that is now an independent publicly traded oil and gas company ; and its indirect stake in hanover compressor , which manufactures equipment used to increase the pressure of natural gas and facilitate its flow on interstate pipelines . yesterday , investors anxiously awaited a report by moody \' s investors service , which like other major credit - rating firms , currently ranks enron \' s debt at the lowest investment - grade level . if enron were to lose its investment - grade status , it could be forced to repay or refinance up to $ 3 . 9 billion in debt , while other traders would probably further curtail business . but by late yesterday , moody \' s ( news / quote ) decided not to issue a statement after receiving assurances from enron and dynegy officials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soon , the executives said . a moody \' s spokesman declined comment . executives close to the talks said that they hoped that new cash from dynegy would reassure both wall street and the energy - trading markets that enron \' s trading floor would survive and remain a valuable asset . but analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring how much value the trading operation has already lost , and how much the business has been reduced because of credit concerns . " i believe dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in the core business and wants to renegotiate the purchase price as a result , " said andre meade , head of united states utilities research for commerzbank securities in new york . " i don \' t think anyone can estimate the earning power of enron over the next three to four quarters , and i \' m not sure enron has a good estimate . " mr . meade said he did not believe that dynegy \' s earlier estimate that the acquisition would add 90 cents a share to its earnings was " reliable today , given how sharply the business seems to have deteriorated . " by mr . meade \' s calculations , if enron \' s trading volumes were to fall 50 percent next year - even if normal volume growth levels returned in 2003 - that would wipe out nearly all the value in the stock . karen denne , an enron spokeswoman , said the company had experienced a decline in energy trading volume and in the number of traders doing business with it , but both stabilized yesterday . she declined to elaborate or quantify the decline . she also said that enron \' s trading operation remained profitable , though she could not quantify it , and she also said she did not know whether the company was working on a possible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans should its business and liquidity worsen . " we \' re moving forward with the merger , " she said . dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday . shares of enron rose yesterday on news of a possible revised acquisition agreement . they closed at $ 4 . 11 , up 2 . 5 percent , or 10 cents . shares of dynegy closed at $ 40 . 89 , up 4 . 2 percent , or $ 1 . 64 . though yesterday \' s gains halted a four - day slide in enron shares , the stock is down 95 percent this year after disclosures of major losses as well as significant accounting errors that led enron to admit it overstated profits during the last five years by nearly $ 600 million . now , difficulties within enron \' s trading operation are exacerbating the company \' s overall liquidity problems in three ways , according to some analysts and rival energy - trading executives . first , other traders are requiring enron to put up greater margin on its trades . on top of that , in some cases enron \' s traders are being forced to pay more to buy natural gas than traders at other companies . this credit premium in some transactions has ranged from 3 cents to 6 cents for every million british thermal units of gas enron buys , these people say . additionally , many traders , like the mirant corporation ( news / quote ) , have either scaled back or stopped doing business with enron , hurting its trading revenue . mr . meade of commerzbank said " end - use customers and trading counterparties appear to be shifting their business to competitors as a result of enron \' s credit concerns and are reluctant to increase their exposures to enron .

" there are people who think that \' s the greatest thing since sliced bread and there are people who think that \' s the worst thing , " he said . delaplane said his organization wants to preserve employers \' right to contribute company stock to employee retirement plans but also supports efforts to educate workers so that they can make better informed investment decisions . david certner , a pensions specialist with the american association of retired persons ( aarp ) , said there is plenty of work to be done in that area . " many employees aren \' t aware of basic rules of investing , nor of the meaning of diversification . some actually view employer stock as a less risky investment than a mutual fund , " he said .', 'subject': 'important info about your 401 k plan'}

{'body': "while recent events have dramatically impacted enron ' s travel volume , alliance worldwide ( formerly travel agency in the park ) wanted to contact you regarding the enron travel program . since 1984 , our company has been a strategic business partner with enron and has provided a complete scope of services from booking , ticketing , ticket delivery , customer service , reporting , management of clicktrip , to facilitating preferred vendor arrangements with airlines to benefit enron . these services have been provided on a management fee basis from alliance to enron . as of december 1 , 2001 the management fee has been suspended during enron ' s period of reorganization . we are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing fee per ticket . to provide you with a brief history of our arrangement , enron and alliance approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront discounts for enron ' s business travel . these discounts are available only through alliance and are given at time of ticketing . all commissions were stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to enron , in exchange for enron paying alliance a contracted management fee . this management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each enron cost center based on the total number of transactions . this travel program provided enron over $ 8 . 6 million in airline savings on $ 55 million spent in the year 2000 and over $ 5 . 2 million on $ 33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of 2001 . these savings are after the payment of the travel agency management fee . the effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by the airlines cannot yet be determined . we have contacted the airline companies and most of enron ' s preferred carriers have agreed to extend the contracts through april 2002 . you may utilize these discounts through alliance by calling 713 650 - 8080 or 1 800 962 - 0248 . in march , enron and alliance will begin evaluating enron ' s volume and travel patterns , and determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure . as mentioned earlier , alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in lieu of a management fee . these fees are reimbursable to enron employees through normal expense report procedures . specifically , the new fee structure is based on zero - commission contracts for tickets purchased from enron ' s preferred carriers . the fee schedule for all airline tickets for enron travel is as follows : $ 30 - domestic tickets with or without upfront discount $ 30 - international tickets without upfront discount 25 % of savings , capped at $ 175 - international tickets with upfront discount $ 15 - southwest airlines and clicktrip reservations , hotel / car only bookings the savings to enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees that are charged . for example , enron ' s average ticket prices are $ 589 domestic and $ 2207 international ( after discounts ) . enron ' s average savings are $ 144 domestic and $ 587 international ( before fees ) . the savings are more than three times the per ticket fee ! if you are accustomed to booking your own travel online , you may continue to do so by booking through clicktrip . clicktrip is the only online booking tool that allows access to enron ' s negotiated discounts . ticketing through clicktrip also bears a smaller fee of $ 15 if no agent assistance is necessary . there is no charge to look at schedules . clicktrip is available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through enron ' s intranet site or via the internet site . clicktrip is also a useful tool for checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status . to check upgrade status or to review a ticketed itinerary , simply click the check my trip button on the clicktrip home page and fill in your name and amadeus locator number ( provided at the top of your itinerary ) . a user log - in may be obtained by contacting alliance at 713 328 - 5100 . if your office location , phone number or any profile information has changed , please notify us by return email . a profile form is attached if you prefer to fax the information to alliance at 713 328 - 5600 or if you are a new traveler wishing to set up a profile . we at alliance are proud of our 17 year association with enron and dedicated to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price for all of your travel needs . we have a highly trained and experienced staff working on enron ' s account and we look forward to providing you with continued service for years to come . if you have any questions regarding any of the changes mentioned , or wish to discuss specific details relating to your corporate travel policies , please call me 713 328 - 5139 , or email lhinson @ allianceworldwide . com . sincerely , lee ann hinson director account management 713 328 - 5139 lhinson @ allianceworldwide . com >", 'subject': 'travel services'}

it ' s the morning of january 29 th and i wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased i am to have been selected as enron ' s interim ceo . my firm , zolfo cooper , my partners and i have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process . i just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward . i can ' t imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you . i ' m sure it ' s been incredibly difficult , particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched . in that environment , i ' ve got to believe it ' s difficult , if not impossible , for you to focus on what lies ahead for enron and for the organization . i ' m not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning , however , i ' d like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this . it ' s been the experience of myself , my firm , my partners , that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy , we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings . those metrics are typically the organization , the asset base that the company has to bring to bear , customer base , and liquidity . from what i ' ve been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here , enron has a very , very bright , very capable , very committed , hardworking and dedicated organization . all of the people i have met are committed to reorganize , restructure and bring enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy . number 2 , the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here . the regulated assets , the pipelines , the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around . third , loyal customers . most of enron ' s customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis . and fourth , liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand , the cash it expects to generate in the near term , and with the backstop of the dip financing , it doesn ' t appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward . with those four resources nicely in place , i ' m very confident that we can successfully restructure this company . i don ' t want to leave the impression that it will be easy . it ' s going to be an enormous amount of work . there will be upsets , issues , and concerns along the way . but i can tell you that i ' ve seen companies in bankruptcy that don ' t have nearly as strong a position as this company . they were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy , and i ' m certain enron will also . i ' m looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and i ' m very pleased to be here . jeff , ray and i will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward . if there are any thoughts , concerns , issues that you would like to bring to my attention , please don ' t hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call . thanks so much , and i look forward to working with all of you .", 'subject': "transcripts of steve cooper ' s voicemails"}

{'body': "earlier today , steve cooper left the following voicemail for employees . since some employees do not have access to voicemail , we are providing the following transcript of that message . voicemail transcript - steve cooper february 14 , 2002 hi everybody , this is steve cooper . it is february 14 , so happy valentine ' s day to everybody . i just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - i want to make sure that i keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what ' s going on . first of all , i want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails . they ' ve been very supportive and i thank you for that . i do intend to get back to everybody personally - - i ' ve just been busy and jammed up this week , but i do want you to know i really appreciate it . it ' s been a little hectic this week , so i do apologize for the delay in getting back to you . anyway , a couple of things have happened this week and i just want to make sure everybody understands what they are . number one is the result of the special investigative report . we ' re beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result rick buy and rick causey ' s employment with the company has been terminated . to the extent that there are any additional changes , obviously i ' ll keep you up to speed . we ' re also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the board . six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days . we ' re initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors , which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted . at the board meeting this week , i reiterated that it ' s my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor ' s committee by the second quarter , and nothing that i see today leads me conclude that we can ' t make that schedule . i continue to believe that there is a very nice re - organizable platform here , so that the company can move forward . there was some bad news with respect to enron stock . as far as i can tell , the claims base here - that is bank debt , bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward . as a result , it ' s not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders . that ' s not good news . it ' s an unfortunate result of this problem , and i wish it was different . but i don ' t want you to be misled and i don ' t want any of you to believe that there is value there , because i don ' t think there will be . in particular i don ' t want you to continue to invest your earnings in enron stock without being aware of , at least in my view , shareholder value at the end of the day . the media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation . i don ' t believe that will be the case here . i think we have a tough road to hoe . i think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team . none the less , i do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here , and i ' m absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen . a couple of other things that i want you to be aware of : as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team , we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles , responsibilities are . we are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program , which i know is important to all of you . as that gets cemented , i will provide you with additional updates . and another thing , i ' ve asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid - march , an employee meeting at one of these local hotels . it will , more likely than not , be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go . what i thought we would do is give everybody , in a plain vanilla way , a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there . then we will have a giant question and answer session , so that if any of you have concerns , issues , problems , or upsets , we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things . that ' s where we stand as of valentine ' s day . once again , i would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support . again , i apologize that i haven ' t been able to get back to you as quickly as i would like , but i promise you i will and i hope everybody has a great day . if you have any questions or issues , send me an email , give me a buzz or drop by my office . i would be more than happy to have a chat with you . happy valentine ' s day . thanks again so much and i ' ll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible .", 'subject': 'steve cooper voicemail -

{'body': "on friday , steve cooper left the following voicemail for employees . since some employees do not have access to voicemail , we are providing the following transcript of that message . you can also access this message and past messages at : http : / / home . enron . com / updates / . voicemail from : steve cooper date : friday , march 1 , 2002 hi everybody . it ' s steve cooper . it ' s friday afternoon , march 1 . i hope everybody has had a great week . i want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week , so that you all will be fully in the loop . the week started in a rough - and - tumble fashion . i went to a town meeting monday night to meet with a number of our ex - colleagues . their disappointment , upset and anger is very understandable . i , along with the entire management team , have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues . in order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on , we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $ 5 million fund . we are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees . i wanted you to be aware of that . i really do appreciate and understand everybody ' s upset . last friday , february 22 , we presented to the creditors ' committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program . as can be expected , there was some push back from the committee - - there were issues about some of the data , there were requests for additional data and further clarification . the creditors ' committee formed a subcommittee . we provided to them more data . jeff mcmahon and i met with them on wednesday , february 27 , and we met with them again on thursday , february 28 . we are scheduled to meet with them again on monday and tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the creditors ' committee on this program . i have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is jeff ' s and my highest priority . it is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future , their future compensation , and any financial safety net , so we are going to have to move on this at light speed . i told the creditors ' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of march 11 to motion this up to the court . i ' ll keep you posted on progress . i am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs . hopefully , by the time we have the employee meeting , we can walk through the composition of the program in detail . the powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions . hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week . then , the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases . and it works its way through the review , approval and communication process . so hopefully , we ' ll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases . we reached an accord with the astros this week to repatriate to enron $ 2 . 1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract . it is a shame we won ' t be in a position to support the naming of the field , but it is probably in the best interest of the estate . i got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning enron field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex - employees ' fund . i ' d like your input on that . i thought it was a great idea and very generous . we are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month . hopefully i ' ll be able to meet many of you there . i ' ve tried to get around to say hello here and there . and again , i would encourage you if you have any questions , concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz . sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you , but i ' m making a very concerted effort to answer everybody ' s inquiries . other than that i don ' t have a lot to report . we ' ll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program . hopefully by next friday i ' ll be able to report very substantial progress in this area . i want to thank everybody for their efforts , all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward . one other thing ? we did have a bank meeting on thursday afternoon . we have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here . we ' ll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting . i told the bank group , and it was echoed by management , that we believe there is a reorganizable , viable entity in enron ' s future . i ' ll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting . anyway , as i was saying ? thanks so much for all your hard work , your efforts , your dedication . i hope you have a great weekend . i ' ll chat with next week .", 'subject': 'steve cooper voicemail - 03 / 01 / 2002'}

{'body': 'gov . davis announced today his appointment of mike peevey as commissioner at the cpuc to replace com . bilas who resigned last week . mr . peevey is the former president of southern california edison and as such advocated deregulation . consumer group advocates are concerned about his past record and oppose his nomination which is subject to state senate approval . below is an article from the sacramento bee . gh davis names ex - edison chief to puc but the action stirs anger : \' our worst nightmare , \' says a consumer lawyer . by stuart leavenworth - - bee staff writer published 5 : 30 a . m . pst wednesday , march 6 , 2002 gov . gray davis has appointed a former president of southern california edison to a state panel charged with regulating edison and other public utilities . davis said michael r . peevey would bring " more than three decades of experience " to the public utilities commission - - experience that immediately came under fire from the state \' s consumer groups . mike florio , a lawyer for the utility reform network , said peevey has a record , both in government and in business , of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers . " this is a our worst nightmare , " florio said . " it is like putting dr . kevorkian in charge of a nursing home . " others were more supportive . d . j . smith , a lobbyist who represents large industrial energy users , lauded peevey as someone " who understands all sides of the energy business " and will be fair to all sides . " i think he will be objective about edison because he doesn \' t owe edison anything , " said smith , noting that peevey left the southern california utility nine years ago . the husband of assemblywoman carol liu , d - south pasadena , peevey replaces puc commissioner richard bilas , who resigned last week . bilas was appointed by gov . pete wilson . if confirmed by the state senate , peevey will solidify davis \' control over the puc , a five - member board that now includes three of the governor \' s appointees . it also comes at a time when the commission is fighting with the state \' s other large utility , pacific gas and electric co . , on terms for pg & e \' s reorganization in federal bankruptcy court . pg & e spokesman ron low declined to comment on the appointment tuesday , but last year peevey was involved with a handshake deal that might have helped pg & e avoid bankruptcy . hired by davis to negotiate with the utility , peevey reportedly struck a deal with pg & e chairman bob glynn that would have let pg & e charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity . but other davis advisers objected to the deal and the negotiations ultimately fell apart . for three years , peevey was president of edison international and southern california edison before leaving in 1993 in a reported power struggle with company chairman john bryson . peevey then became a public affairs consultant and then president of newenergy inc . , an energy service provider that was sold in 1999 to aes corp . after working as an adviser to davis , he had been ceo of truepricing inc . and also has served on the board of excelergy corp . , an energy software company . with his new six - year puc job , peevey will regulate not only electric utilities but telecommunications giants , water companies , natural gas supplies and other industries . after a review by puc lawyers , peevey will have to divest holdings and resign from positions that could cause a conflict , davis spokesman steve maviglio said . peevy \' s appointment was one of two davis made tuesday . he also appointed john l . geesman to the board of the independent system operator , which manages most of the state power grid . since 1985 , geesman has been the managing director of fixed income banking for rbc dain rauscher inc . in san francisco . he once served on turn \' s board . consumer groups , which had pressed for a meeting with davis for the past week , said the he may have timed his election day appointment of peevey to minimize negative media coverage . maviglio called that claim " ludicrous .

{'body': 'as a follow - up to our meeting last friday , i have reviewed the comprehensive settlement agreement ( csa ) , socalgas system adequacy proceeding testimony of lad lorenz and the cpuc dec . 11 , 2001 decision on unbundling the socalgas system by implementing the csa with modifications . i also have a call into rodger schwecke at socal to discuss their upcoming tariff filing and the related capacity issues . some of the pertinent points made in these documents relative to receipt point capacity and allocation are as follows : comprehensive settlement agreement appendix b outlines the details of backbone transmission / receipt point capacity rights : 1 . all receipt points will be defined with firm capacity and primary access rights that reflect physical limitations . the appendix b table of receipt point capacity indicates that for no . needles , transwestern has primary access rights of 750 mmcf / d and mojave at hector road has secondary access rights . 2 . for interconnects into socalgas with more than one upstream pipeline , secondary access rights will be defined . 3 . new or expanded interconnects with existing or new pipelines will have secondary access rights only and will be subject to bumping by gas scheduled through primary access points . in the text of the csa , the open season procedures for intrastate backbone transmission / receipt point capacity are described in detail . briefly , its proposed to work as follows : 1 . initial reservation for core customers . socalgas acquisitions , core transport agents and wholesale customers serving the core will be provided a set aside amount of capacity . this included 300 mmcf / d at north needles . 2 . first stage / phase i of the open season for 50 % of rp capacity after deducting core customer set aside . existing noncore customers may bid on any rp capacity up to 100 % of their historical usage . 3 . second stage / phase ii of the open season for remainder of phase i capacity , if any , not awarded or allocated . available to same existing noncore customers as in phase i to bid on in this second round if they haven \' t been awarded capacity up to their 100 % historical usage . 4 . third stage / phase iii of the open season for 50 % of rp capacity after deducting core customer set aside plus any remaining capacity not awarded in phases i and ii . bidding open to any existing or new customers with creditworthiness established . 5 . socalgas will hold annual open seasons for expired or non - contracted available capacity . 6 . market concentration limits were set such that no person or entity including affiliates may hold more than 40 % of the capacity ( after core set aside ) at any one receipt point awarded through the open season process . this does not include secondary market capacity or individually negotiated contracts acquired after the initial open season . examples of north needles capacity : physical capacity 750 mmcf / d add \' l 25 / 50 775 / 800 core cust . set aside 300 inc . core 313 avail . cap . for bidding 450 462 / 487 phase i avail . cap . 225 231 / 243 . 5 phase ii avail . cap . remainder of 225 remainder of 231 or 243 . 5 phase iii avail . cap . 225 + remainder 231 / 243 . 5 + of phases i & ii if any . remainder of ph . i & ii if any . system adequacy proceeding - - lorenz testimony lad lorenz testifies that the proposal to allocate firm receipt point capacity on the socalgas system is intended to be used " until the commission acts in the gir proceeding " . in section h . of lad \' s testimony on firm receipt point access , table ii illustrates that north needles will be expanded by 50 mmcf / d to a level of 800 . in table iii under the heading of firm primary access it states " tw - - who then allocates among its shippers " in reference to the 800 mmcf / d of capacity listed for north needles . in this same section h , lad states that this alternative proposal for allocating primary firm capacity at each receipt point will achieve improved reliability " until the commission acts to approve the csa " . cpuc decision 01 - 12 - 018 on socalgas unbundling the commission approved the csa on dec . 11 , 2001 with certain modifications . these modifications included : 1 . market concentration limits were decreased from 40 % to 30 % and included capacity attained in subsequent open seasons or by individually negotiated contracts . secondary market capacity remains excluded from the market concentration limit . 2 . a secondary market price cap was established at 120 % of the interruptible rate ( $ . 07191 ) . 3 . reinstated the core reservation for intrastate capacity at 1044 mmcf / d ( csa lowered it to 1000 ) . this explains why the core reservation for needles is 313 and doesn \' t match the tw / socal contract level . the additional 44 was allocated per a calpine proposal on a prorata basis to each receipt point with needles receiving an additional 13 mmcf / d . in the summary and conclusion sections of the decision , socalgas was directed to include the additional 375 mmcf / d of new backbone and receipt point capacity in its open season . this part of the order did not provide any direction as to how the new capacity was to be allocated to upstream pipelines . additionally socalgas was directed to file an advice letter for implementation and to include proposed methods for allocating any additional future capacity additions .', 'subject': 'socalgas unbundling / receipt point capacity'}

cut north - flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from la plata to meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling through kemmerer ; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries from receipt points south of the meacham compressor closely approximate confirmed nominations ; entitle for undertakes or overtakes , as appropriate ; and finally , if required , northwest will issue operational flow orders . if net scheduled volumes north through northwest ' s kemmerer compressor do not exceed physical capacity , northwest will have much greater flexibility during the clay basin and transwestern shut - ins . northwest ' s customers can help themselves and reduce the likelihood that kemmerer will overschedule by securing adequate gas from canadian suppliers or by using their jackson prairie storage during this work . northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of the clay basin and transwestern shut - ins and will be monitoring the situation closely . northwest will take every opportunity to relax system restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate . northwest is confident that if its customers respond prudently , the impact of the transwestern and questar maintenance will be greatly reduced . if you have any questions , please contact your marketing services representative .", 'subject': 'fwd : nwp system notice - system operations'}
